<h2 id="content-as-conversation">Content as Conversation</h2>

<p>If you think about it, in a typical website, your site just doesn&rsquo;t exist until somebody comes to it. And somebody comes to it because they have a need, they have a question.</p>

<p>Basically they want to start a conversation with your website. And if you&rsquo;re website does not converse well back to them, they are going to go somewhere else because you&rsquo;re not satisfying the need that they came with.</p>

<p>I really came up with the idea of content as conversation in the web arena. But thinking about it, it&rsquo;s actually what I&rsquo;ve done for my entire career.</p>

<p>It is to push people to think of whatever they write as a conversation.</p>

<p>A computer manual, for example, is also a conversation. And if you think through the conversation, that is talking to the other person in your head, you&rsquo;ll write much better. Whatever you&rsquo;re writing, don&rsquo;t think about it as me, me, me. I have all this to say to people.</p>

<p>Because then you&rsquo;re just shouting into a void and not working with the other person who is involved with this.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-web-is-for-self-service">The Web is for Self-Service</h2>

<p>I think most people started their websites on the metaphor of a filing cabinet. Whether they made that explicit or not.</p>

<p>What they were really doing was putting up all of their documents and sort of saying, &ldquo;Here are our filing cabinets. We&rsquo;ll open the doors and let you rummage around them yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I think that is a very poor metaphor for a website. Because people don&rsquo;t come to the website for documents.</p>

<p>They come for information. They come to get answers to their questions. They come to have these conversations.</p>

<p>And therefore what I think the web really should be and has been, the web is a telephone. The web is all about self-service.</p>

<p>So in a sense, the web is replacing customer service calls.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="write-like-a-human">Write Like A Human</h2>

<p>Content as conversation actually starts before you think about what you&rsquo;re going to write or say. It&rsquo;s just that concept that there is another human being in this with you.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t only about what I have to say, it&rsquo;s about hearing the other person in your head as you&rsquo;re writing.</p>

<p>Imagine the person you&rsquo;re in this conversation with. And imagine their lives. It&rsquo;s not only who they are.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the idea that someone is going to be coming at 11 o&rsquo;clock at night, when they&rsquo;re tired and the bank is closed, and there is no way to ask a question. And they really need to accomplish this transaction. They&rsquo;re tired. The kids have been put to bed.</p>

<p>Imagine this person and they&rsquo;re emotional attitude. And so when you&rsquo;re writing, you really are communicating with people.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-do-you-want-to-achieve-by-writing-this">What Do You Want To Achieve By Writing This?</h2>

<p>Most people think of it as I have this content to say. And don&rsquo;t realize that in the workplace, everything from an email to a webpage is actually serving some purpose.</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s getting people to buy something or stop doing something, or getting your proposal funded.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s such a different situation then the way we were all writing in school.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just getting people to realize what they write is supposed to achieve something.</p>

<p>You must write: when someone reads this, they will do &ldquo;x&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>And when you read this, you will <a href="https://twitter.com">share</a> it.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks, Ginny.</em></p>
