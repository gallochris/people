<p><em>This is a conversation between William Ury and Simon Sinek. The two discuss Ury&rsquo;s new book, <a href="http://www.williamury.com/books/getting-to-yes-with-yourself/">Getting to Yes with Yourself</a>, and other negotiation tips.</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s a dense back-and-forth, so you might find yourself rewinding the video a bit like I did. Sinek adds a lot with his questions (listen to <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">his TED talk</a> if you haven&rsquo;t before) and shares his own experiences too. Check out the excerpt below and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqV6pjX_dP0">video here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-stops-us-from-getting-to-yes-2-04-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-2m4s">What stops us from getting to yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=2m4s">2:04</a></h2>

<p>Over the years it began to sort of dawn on me, as I really started to look at the question of what stops us, what&rsquo;s the real obstacle of us getting to yes or what we truly want in life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that the biggest obstacle of us getting what we want in life or getting to yes is not what we think it is. It&rsquo;s not that difficult person. It&rsquo;s not that difficult organization. They can be difficult for sure.</p>

<p>But the most difficult person is the person we look at in the mirror every morning. It&rsquo;s right here. It&rsquo;s us.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in our own very human, very understandable tendency to react in ways that don&rsquo;t serve our true interests.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-opposite-of-blame-3-48-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-3m48s">The opposite of blame <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=3m48s">3:48</a></h2>

<p>The opposite of blame is taking responsibility.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, when we blame, we might think that&rsquo;s powerful because you&rsquo;re blaming the other person.</p>

<p>But you&rsquo;re actually subtly disempowering yourself. Because you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s the other person&rsquo;s fault. I don&rsquo;t have any stake in this.</p>

<p>But if you take responsibility, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean blaming yourself, it just means taking a constructive, positive approach towards it. You empower yourself and you&rsquo;re more likely to get what you want.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-does-taking-responsibility-mean-7-07-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-7m07s">What does taking responsibility mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=7m07s">7:07</a></h2>

<p>Taking responsibility doesn&rsquo;t mean blaming yourself. It means accepting that you&rsquo;re part of it.</p>

<p>That it&rsquo;s yours. You&rsquo;re a co-creator of that situation. Even if, in your mind, you might be 1% of the problem, you&rsquo;re still a co-creator of that.</p>

<p>And that gives you the power to change it. Because once you take responsibility, you can change.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re blaming, you can&rsquo;t change. You&rsquo;re just dependent on the other side. In fact, you&rsquo;re their prisoner.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="batna-7-38-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-7m38s">BATNA <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=7m38s">7:38</a></h2>

<p>In negotiation, the secret to power is often what we call your BATNA. You&rsquo;re best alternative to a negotiated agreement.</p>

<p>In other words, before you go into a negotiation, what am I going to do to advance my interests, if for some reason I&rsquo;m not able to reach an agreement.</p>

<p>If I can&rsquo;t reach an agreement with this particular organization about a job, maybe I&rsquo;ve got another job opportunity.</p>

<p>Or if I can&rsquo;t reach an agreement with one customer, maybe I&rsquo;ve got another customer. In other words, knowing you have that alternative, it gives you a sense of confidence and freedom.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is I&rsquo;ve taught that for 30 years, people often don&rsquo;t do it. Why don&rsquo;t they do it? They&rsquo;re just focused on the agreement.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t think about their BATNA. I&rsquo;ve come to realize, in fact, maybe there is a psychological antecedent. This all goes back to, again, yourself.</p>

<p>Which is an inner-BATNA. The commitment to yourself that you&rsquo;re going to take care of your own needs. Which then makes you less psychologically dependent on the other side.</p>

<p>And then oddly enough, like if you&rsquo;re in a relationship, if you&rsquo;re less dependent psychologically or emotionally on your partner, you&rsquo;re likely to have a better relationship.</p>

<p>Because you care. But you don&rsquo;t care that much that you&rsquo;re going to get highly triggered every time you get together.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="is-the-universe-unfriendly-or-friendly-10-30-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-10m30s">Is the universe unfriendly or friendly? <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=10m30s">10:30</a></h2>

<p>Einstein once said, &ldquo;The most important decision that every human being has to make is to decide whether or not the universe is friendly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why did Einstein say that?</p>

<p>We can choose. If you choose that it&rsquo;s friendly, you&rsquo;re likely to interact with people as if they&rsquo;re possible partners in a cooperative way.</p>

<p>If you think it&rsquo;s unfriendly, and you see everyone as your adversary, and the whole world as hostile, then you&rsquo;re going to behave that way and everyone is going to be very hostile.</p>

<p>He though the future of the human race depended on us answering that question.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="go-to-the-balcony-15-39-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-15m39s">Go to the balcony <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=15m39s">15:39</a></h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to start to invoke your inner scientist and observe what is going on. It&rsquo;s almost like you see what is going on in the negotiation on a stage, and part of your mind goes to a mental and emotional balcony overlooking that stage.</p>

<p>Where you can keep your eyes on the prize. You can see what&rsquo;s going on. A little bit of detachment to observe.</p>

<p>So you can then ask yourself the question, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my why here? What do I really want out of the situation? What&rsquo;s my intention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I&rsquo;m about to go into a difficult negotiation or even a phone call, I like to take a moment or a few minutes of just quiet.</p>

<p>Listen to yourself. Watch yourself. Go to the balcony. Set your intention.</p>

<p>And that helps. If you get caught or carried away with the thing, take a break. Take a time out. And realize it doesn&rsquo;t all have to be done at once.</p>

<p>Have a moment after the interaction to ask yourself, &ldquo;What did I learn here? What would I do differently next time?&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="slow-or-fast-17-40-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-17m40s">Slow or Fast <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=17m40s">17:40</a></h2>

<p>The motto in negotiation is if you want to go fast, you have to go slow. Because human minds don&rsquo;t change in a second.</p>

<p>If you can slow down to where that human mind is, then you have a chance to bring them much faster.</p>

<p>If you go really fast, there is a resistance and they shut down, and then it&rsquo;s going to take a lot longer.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="it-starts-with-you-31-10-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-31m10s">It starts with you <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=31m10s">31:10</a></h2>

<p>Self-acceptance. Maybe the greatest gift you can give yourself.</p>

<p>We all have this voice. This inner critic. That is criticizing and doubting.</p>

<p>Psychologists says we have almost 60,000 thoughts a day or maybe up to that. And the great majority of them are negative. If you actually sat down and counted all the negative thoughts.</p>

<p>The ability to accept yourself. If you can accept yourself, you can accept others. If you respect yourself, you can respect others.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="best-kind-of-leaders-37-35-https-youtu-be-dqv6pjx-dp0-t-37m35s">Best kind of leaders <a href="https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=37m35s">37:35</a></h2>

<p>It goes back to the leaders. It&rsquo;s not the charismatic leader that is necessarily the best one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the one that is willing to be accountable. The one that does the hard work. They&rsquo;re not so flashy. They have humility.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re able to learn. And that opens them up. It&rsquo;s infectious to the rest of the organization.</p>

<p><em>Right on, Mr. Ury.</em></p>
