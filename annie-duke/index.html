<p><em><a href="http://annieduke.com/meet-annie-duke/">Annie Duke</a> went from academia to become a professional poker player that won the 2004 World Series of Poker bracelet. Duke recently wrote, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216355/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532885476&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=thinking+in+bets">Thinking in Bets</a>, where she provides guidelines on how to make smarter decisions. Highly recommend her <a href="http://annieduke.com/annie-dukes-analysis/">newsletter</a> as well.</em></p>

<p><em>This is a long conversation hosted by Jordan Thibodeau with Talks at Google. I recommend reading these <a href="https://medium.com/@westofthesun/thinking-in-bets-annie-duke-f011c0067b22">books notes</a> and listening along to the <a href="https://youtu.be/uYNsSeYjkp4">conversation here</a>. I found these tibdits from the Q&amp;A section at the end most interesting because here&rsquo;s an expert giving human answers. It was refreshing to hear no one has it figured out.</em></p>

<h2 id="how-to-address-imposter-syndrome-and-overconfidence-1-01-51-https-youtu-be-uynsseyjkp4-t-1h1m51s">How to address imposter syndrome and overconfidence  <a href="https://youtu.be/uYNsSeYjkp4?t=1h1m51s">1:01:51</a></h2>

<p>I think the overconfidence piece is a little bit easier to deal with because if you have a really good decision group, they&rsquo;re going to check your overconfidence. That&rsquo;s going to be part of the conversation all the time. Are you feeling overconfident?</p>

<p>Imposter syndrome. It&rsquo;s a hard one. I feel it all the time. I feel about this book. I feel it when I get up and give talks. Why am I even opening my mouth?</p>

<p>And I think that, again, it&rsquo;s like get other people to talk to you. You know, what they can do is they can often see things more clearly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had conversations where I&rsquo;ve said, I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m such an imposter, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about. And people will say, well people keep hiring you for speeches, they&rsquo;ll actually go through it. They refer you out, they&rsquo;re buying your book.</p>

<p>Have other people look at you in a more objective way, it can get you out of you own head. I really feel like that is the way to do it.</p>

<p>I highly recommend everyone read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X">Power of Habit</a> because it really teaches you how to change your habits. Not just like going to the gym. Your habits of mind, the way you think.</p>

<p>Remember, when I said I had that conversation with Erik Seidel, now when I went to the table, I was thinking about what Erik Seidel might say later. When you have a really good decision group that&rsquo;s checking your bias, whether it&rsquo;s overconfidence, underconfidence, or imposter syndrome, the group gets in your head in a really good way.</p>

<p>Trust me, when I leave this room and I&rsquo;m in the car, I&rsquo;m going to think about what a bad talk I gave. So, maybe I did? Now, I&rsquo;m in my head.</p>

<p>When I do that, hopefully, I have a group of people that I can sort of offload that to and they can offload things like that to me. And hopefully, they&rsquo;re talking to me. Not physically, but I&rsquo;m sort of running that conversation.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s sort of what happened at the poker table. If I was processing the world in a way that was irrational, I would run the conversation with Erik, or my brother, or John Hennigan, or whoever it might be later, where they were telling me, oh come on.</p>

<p>And that would help me when I was kind of on my own. So, I think about it as what are the rewards you&rsquo;re getting and how are the people around you sort of helping to shape those habits of mind.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s so hard to do on your own. I think we all really need help with this.</p>

<h2 id="self-compassion-1-04-35-https-youtu-be-uynsseyjkp4-t-1h4m35s">Self compassion <a href="https://youtu.be/uYNsSeYjkp4?t=1h4m35s">1:04:35</a></h2>

<p>I think another mistake is if we know about, like if I know about imposter syndrome or if I know about overcondifence, and I&rsquo;m really smart, problem solved.</p>

<p>High IQ correlates positively with motived reasoning. And you can think why that is, right? Like how do you slice and dice the info?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re cognitively agile, you&rsquo;re going to be able to slice and dice a story that sounds a lot more convincing to yourself and others about why everything you believe is true. Why every prediction you have is 100 percent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m smart, and I know about this isn&rsquo;t exactly a solution.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m telling you I&rsquo;m going to walk away from this and think about what a bad job I did.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want you guys to think that you practice these things and somewhow it&rsquo;s ever solved. <strong>It&rsquo;s not</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s do I catch myself doing it more often? Do I do it less?</p>

<p>Just doing it less and catching myself more often is huge.</p>

<p>Instead of berating yourself for all the times that you screw up, you get to celebrate that you did it one fewer times.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s such a more self compassionate way to live. I&rsquo;m trying to get there.</p>
