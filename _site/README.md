People | Hot Dogs and Eggs 
========================

This is the source of a subdomain for my personal website, [people.hotdogsandeggs.com](http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com).

It's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Many moons ago I was a sports information director. A fancy way of saying I helped cover the athletic teams at my alma mater, UNC. One of my tasks was to transcribe quotes to help reporters meet deadlines. I hated transcribing audio at the time, but somehow miss it today.

This site is a collection of transcriptions of talks and interviews I find interesting across the web. The transcriptions are more infrequent now, here is one of my favorites from [Allan Branch](http://people.hotdogsandeggs.com/allan-branch).
