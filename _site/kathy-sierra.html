     <p><em>The following is an excerpt from 2010 Gov 2.0 Expo with Kathy Sierra. She has given this talk several times and spread the message on her <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">blog</a>. Special thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OreillyMedia">O'Reilly Media</a> for hosting the video. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM55NiXSOPs">full talk here</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Kicking Ass</h2>

<p>Where there is passion, there are people kicking ass. People don't sustain passion for things they continue to suck at.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that passion is compelling for people is because when they are pursing something, learning and growing - they start to have a higher resolution. They have deeper, richer experiences for the things they are passionate about.</p>

<p>For example, the more you learn about a particular style of music - you actually hear more than the rest of us. You hear subtleties. It's as if the music changed it's resolution.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Higher Resolution</h2>

<p>High resolution means deeper, richer experiences. And that's the kind of thing we need to create for people or we're not going to have passion.</p>

<p>Because it always exists where there is passion.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Create Killer Users</h2>

<p>Yeah, this is an obvious thing. But it's amazing how little we focus on that when we want people to become passionate. Because we are so focused on our role.</p>

<p>We're going to make better products. We're going to make better services. We're going to deliver better things for people.</p>

<p>They really don't care what you do. I'm not passionate about what you do. I'm passionate about what <em>I</em> do. It's your job to enable that.</p>

<p>Quit thinking about making a better "x". Think about making a better user of "x".</p>

<p>For example, I work with authors a lot. This distinction can mean ripping out 200 pages that are designed to make the author look smart. And adding 200 pages that make the actual reader smart.</p>

<p>As programmers, you're familiar with the idea of making a killer app. But that's not what we want to make if we want passion. We need to create a killer user.</p>

<p>That is a different mindset. And it might be a completely different feature set. When you stop thinking about what you're delivering, and start thinking about what they're doing.</p>

<p><em>Brilliant.</em></p>
