        <title>Jeff Bezos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff Bezos is the Amazon.com Founder &amp;amp; CEO. This is a short chat brought to you by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetassociation.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Association&lt;/a&gt;. The association’s President &amp;amp; CEO, Michael Beckerman, discusses business, the early days of Amazon, space, and the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a conversation that gets more interesting as it goes on because it’s full of wisdom. Read through some bits and pieces below, and go watch the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqL3tyCQ1yY&quot;&gt;37-minute discussion here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;did-you-anticipate-what-would-happen-over-the-last-22-years-at-amazon-153httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt1m53s&quot;&gt;Did you anticipate what would happen over the last 22 years at Amazon? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=1m53s&quot;&gt;1:53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is God no. So Amazon started as a small company. It was me and a few other people. I was driving all the packages myself to the post office in my 1987 Chevy Blazer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I raised money for Amazon, I had to raise a million dollars. Which I raised from 22 different investors, $50,000 dollars each. They got 20 percent of the company for the million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 people told me no. So I had to take 60 meetings to get 20 yes’s. The first question was always what is the Internet? And I had to walk through that. This was 1994, early 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So did I anticipate, fast forward to today and the current version? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been one foot in front of the other. And I think that is true for most businesses. Where you kind of proceed adaptively, it’s step-by-step. You have a success and then you kind of double-down on that success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you kind of figure out what you can do, what customers want. Everything we’ve done and all the success we’ve had, at it’s root, is primarily due to the fact we’ve put customers first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-should-consumers-be-thinking-about-amazon-414httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt4m14s&quot;&gt;How should consumers be thinking about Amazon? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=4m14s&quot;&gt;4:14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is something that people get confused about sometimes. What is Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do such a diverse array of things, from producing original content at Amazon Studios, to Amazon web services where we sell startups and enterprises computing infrastructure, to the things that most people know about which is our consumer offering where we deliver things in little brown boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This things seem some disparate. How is it that we’re doing all of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common thread, and really what it is, is an approach. We have a very distinctive approach that we’ve been honing, thinking about, and refining for 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really just a few principles that we use that we go about these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very top of the list is one I’ve already mentioned, but you’ll probably hear it 10 times tonight because it’s so central. And it is customer obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s customer obsession instead of, for example, competitor obsession or business model obsession or product model obsession or technology obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to center a business. And by the way, many of them can work. I know, and have friends who lead competitor obsessed companies. And those companies can be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a bad strategy. But you have to be really good at close following. You identify winners when you watch your competitors very carefully. If they latch onto something, you do it as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very good strategy in some ways because you don’t have to go down blind alleys. If you’re not pioneering, you’re only close following. It has some advantages, but it has some disadvantages too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I like the customer obsession model. I think it’s the right one. It’s better than product obsession even. Product obsession is not bad, but I think customer obsession gets you there in a healthier way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s one of the principles, the approaches we take in every single that we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;invent-and-pioneer-626httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt6m26s&quot;&gt;Invent and Pioneer &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=6m26s&quot;&gt;6:26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is that we are willing, and even eager to invent and pioneer. I think that goes along, it marries really well with customer obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers are always dissatisfied, even when they don’t know it, even when they think they’re happen they actually do want a better way and they just don’t know yet what that should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I always warn people, customer obsession is not always just listening to customers. Customer obsession is also inventing on their behalf because it’s not their job to invent for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so you need to be an inventor, and a pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third one that is really central to the way we think about all of our business problems and a bunch of things at Amazon is we’re long-term oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask everybody not to think in two to three year time frames, but to think in five to seven year time frames. When somebody says to me, congratulates Amazon on a good quarter, which is a very common thing to say when looking at your results, I say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I’m thinking to myself is that quarter, those quarterly results were pretty much fully-baked about three years ago. So today, I’m working on a quarter that is going to happen in 2020. Not next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next quarter, for all practical purposes, is done already. And it’s probably been done for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start to think that way, it changes how you spend your time, how you plan, where you put your energy, your ability to look around corners gets better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many things improve if you can take a long-term view. By the way, it’s not natural for humans. It’s a discipline that you have to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of get rich slowly schemes are not big sellers on infomercials. So that’s something you kind of have to steal yourself for, discipline for and teach over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say really it’s a collection of principles and it’s an approach that we deploy. And it’s fun. I dance into work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-worries-you-950httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt9m50s&quot;&gt;What worries you? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=9m50s&quot;&gt;9:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the thing I worry about the most is that we would lose our way on one of those things. That we would lose our obsessive focus on customers or we would somehow become short-term oriented or start to somehow become overly cautious. Failure adverse and therefore kind of unable to invent and pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot invent and pioneer, if you cannot accept failure. To invent, you need to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it is not an experiment. So that’s a very important thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are inseparable twins, failure and invention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to be willing to do that. And it’s embarrassing to fail. It’s always embarrassing to fail, but you have to say, no that’s not how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I say to you, you have a 10 percent chance with a particular decision, a 10 percent chance with a 100x return. You should take that bet every time, but you’re still going to be wrong nine out of 10 times. It’s going to feel bad nine out of 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With technology, the outcomes or the results can be very long-tailed. The payoff can be very asymmetric, which is why you should do so much experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows if you swing for the fences, you hit more home runs, but you also strike out more. But with baseball that analogy doesn’t go far enough, because with baseball, no matter how hard you connect with the ball, you can only get four runs. The success is capped at four runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in business, every once in awhile, you step up to the plate and you hit the ball so hard you get a thousand runs. So when you have that kind of asymmetric payoff, one at-bat can get you a thousand runs, it encourages you to experiment more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the right business decision to experiment more. It’s also right for your customers. Your customers like the successful experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customer-adoption-versus-disruption-1157httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt11m57s&quot;&gt;Customer adoption versus disruption &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=11m57s&quot;&gt;11:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this is a giant misconception in a lot of young entrepreneurs, inexperienced entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that is very fashionable is how disruptive their business plan is going to be. But invention is not disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only customer adoption is disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Amazon, we’ve invented a lot of things that customers did not care about at all. And believe me, they were not disruptive to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only when customers like the new way, that anything becomes disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if somebody comes to you with a business plan that they claim is disruptive, you should ask them to explain it to you in simpler language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simpler language is why our customers going to adopt this? Why are they going to like it? Why is it better than the traditional way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-people-not-know-about-amazon-1310httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt13m10s&quot;&gt;What do people not know about Amazon? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=13m10s&quot;&gt;13:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we’ve been over 20 years on balance been treated very fairly by the media. Not every story written about us is the way we would have written it, if we were writing it ourselves. But on balance, very fairly treated. So wrong might be too strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a piece of our business that is probably not fully appreciated, the scale of it and what’s happening, the energy and the dynamism around it, which is the third party seller part of our business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, roughly half of the company is really third party sales. It’s small businesses. There are 100,00 businesses on Amazon where the businesses make $100,000 or more a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s turned into a gigantic service for them. We even let them stow their products in our fulfillment centers, so their products become Prime eligible, which increases their sales. And a lot of people make their living that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve extended that into other areas too. We have a platform called Kindle direct publishing, so authors can write books and publish them directly. That’s become very successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People make livings. I have so many emails from authors saying because of this program, I’ve been able to quit my job. They already have 25 rejection letters from traditional publishers, because their book didn’t fit in a category or didn’t seem right. But readers disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of this more like gardening. You get all the nutrients right in the soil, and then you see what comes up. And that’s what happens with these third party businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t plan which books people are going to write, we just provide a service that makes it really easy to contact and reach readers. And then they create new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same thing with Amazon Web Services. We create a set of tools, and software developers and companies that employ software developers, they figure out surprising and amazing things to build with these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empowering these third party tools to do things, starting with our third party sellers, authors and AWS, probably the biggest thing that most consumers probably don’t appreciate about Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good investors know it very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overnight-success-1608httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt16m08s&quot;&gt;Overnight success &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=16m08s&quot;&gt;16:08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another overnight success. I’ve noticed all overnight successes take about 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-amazon-look-like-in-10-years-1631httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt16m31s&quot;&gt;What will Amazon look like in 10 years? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=16m31s&quot;&gt;16:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a very good question. On the outside, I think the observable Amazon could change quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you said, 10 years ago, you didn’t think AWS would be such a significant contributor to the business. There could be more things like that in a 10 year time frame that would don’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I hope will not change is that approach that I outlined at the beginning. The customer obsession. The willingness to invent. The patience, letting things develop, accepting failure as a path to getting success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-failure-1707httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt17m7s&quot;&gt;Types of failure &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=17m7s&quot;&gt;17:07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, one thing I should point out about failure, this is a fine point internally, we take it and we don’t need to know about it much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a different kind of failure, which is not what you want. That’s where you have operating history, and you do know what you’re doing, and you just screw it up. That’s not a good failure. That’s just bad operational excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve opened a 130 fulfillment centers. We’re on generation eight of our fulfillment center technology. If we open a new fulfillment center, and just woof it, we have to do some internal examination. That’s not an experiment. That’s just bad execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s different kind of failure, and you need to make sure you’re making the right kind of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right kind of failure should be invention. It’s an experiment. You don’t know if it’s going to work. And you know upfront, you don’t know if it’s going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That shouldn’t be opening a new fulfillment center for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-ideas-and-things-that-will-stay-the-same-1816httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt18m16s&quot;&gt;Big ideas and things that will stay the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=18m16s&quot;&gt;18:16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the approach will stay the same. And the other thing I would advise any entrepreneur or large business or large organization or government organization, you need to identify your big ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should only be two or three of them. A senior leader, the main job of a senior leader is to identify two or three big ideas and then to enforce great execution on those big ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is the big ideas are usually incredibly easy to identify. You shouldn’t need to think about them very much. You already know what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example, for Amazon, the consumer business, the three big ideas are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low prices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fast delivery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vast selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way you know they’re the big ideas is because they’re so obvious. The big ideas should be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the way, it’s very hard to maintain a firm grasp of the obvious at all times. Little things can distract you from the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you have to backup, and say these are the three big ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we always deliver things a little faster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we reduce our cost structure, so we have prices a little lower?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the good thing about these big ideas is that they will be stable in time. So I know for a fact, that 10 years from now, customers are still going to like low prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what happens with technology and everything else, people are going to like faster delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for me to imagine a scenario where 10 years from now, a customer comes to me and says, “Jeff, I love Amazon. I just wished you delivered a little more slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so inconceivable that you can have great conviction as a leader to continue to put energy in driving speed of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know in AWS, customers like low prices. They like availability or they don’t want the services to be down. They like data security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not very hard to figure out what the big ideas are, and then you can keep putting energy into those things. You can spin up those flywheels and they’ll be still paying you dividends 10 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what I’m saying, I’m putting it in kind of a business context, for those of you that are in government, these principles would apply identically to a government organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should figure out what the big ideas are, spin up flywheels, get those things rolling. Make sure you pick things that will still be true 10 years from now or 20 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amazons-approach-to-artificial-intelligence-2114httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt21m14s&quot;&gt;Amazon’s approach to Artificial Intelligence &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=21m14s&quot;&gt;21:14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, this is, it is a renaissance. It’s a golden age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now solving problems with machine learning that were kind of in the rum of science fiction for the last several decades. And natural language understanding, machine vision problems, it really is an amazing renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for decades, AI researchers kind of struggled and made very low progress. Over the last 10 years, it just looks like one of the S-curves. You’re just making a lot of progress over the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and A.I. is a horizontal enabling layer. It will empower and improve every business, every governmental organization, every philanthropic organization. There is no institution in the world that cannot be improved with machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at Amazon, some of the things we’re doing are super obvious. Superficially obvious. They’re interesting, kind of cool, and you should be paying attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking about things like Alexa and Echo, our voice assistant. I’m thinking about our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones. Those things use a tremendous amount of machine learning, machine vision systems, natural language understanding, and a bunch of other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are kind of the showy ones. I would say a lot of the value we’re getting from machine learning is kind of happening beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is things like improved search results, improved product recommendations for customers, improved forecasting for inventory management. And literally hundreds of other things beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say the most exciting thing that we’re working on in machine learning is that we’re determined, through Amazon Web Services where we have all of these corporations and software developers, to make these advanced techniques accessible to every organization even if they don’t have kind of the current class of expertise that’s required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, deploying these techniques for your particular institution’s problems is difficult. It takes a lot of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to go compete for the very best PhD’s in machine learning. It’s difficult for a lot of organizations to win those competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in a great position because of the success of Amazon Web Services to be able to put energy into making those techniques easy and accessible. We’re determined to do that. I think we can build a great business doing that for ourselves, and it would be incredibly enabling for organizations that want to use these sophisticated technologies to improve their own organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-interact-with-elected-officials-2139httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt24m39s&quot;&gt;How do you interact with elected officials? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=24m39s&quot;&gt;21:39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think probably the normal ways. We have a fantastic public policy organization here. We have a bunch of people here in Washington, overtime we’ve grown that group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also do things at the state level. We’re doing certain things at municipal levels too. We work hard at it. It’s really important to work hard at it. You can’t just pretend that people know everything and you don’t have to educate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing we try to do, and I think we’re very good at it, is stay very issued focused. So we try to stay on the things that are specific to Amazon and our customers, and our employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a company, our employees are free to have opinions about every issue they choose to have an opinion about. They can have opinions about anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like Amazon needs to be a little more laser focused than that. On things that are important to our customers and to our employees, as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team does that, they keep us very disciplined in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sustainability-and-environment-commitments-2625httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt26m25s&quot;&gt;Sustainability and environment commitments &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=26m25s&quot;&gt;26:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, we have done a couple things that I think everyone inside the organization is proud of. It’s been hard work, but I think it’s starting to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a program called frustration free packaging. We’ve been working on it for roughly 10 years. It’s a simple idea, but incredibly hard to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go to manufacturers and say you’re producing this thing in a four-color printed package with a cellophane window and lots of twisty wire ties. Or worst case, the clamshell packaging where they seal it in indestructible plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually looked it up, there is a Wikipedia entry for packaging rage. There is a term for this, and that Wikipedia entry has the number of people that go to the Emergency room per year trying to open that indestructible, bubble packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why do manufacturers put things in that packaging?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That packaging is not cheap. It’s not cheap. It’s expensive, has a bunch of flaws. But it shows off the product well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it’s hanging on a hook on store shelf, you can actually see the product as you walk by because it’s in clear plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, at Amazon, that doesn’t matter at all. We’re going to show you great pictures of the product and videos of the product, and customer reviews of the product. The product can be sealed in a tiny little cardboard box that is easy to open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we started this program, and we teach people how to make Internet packaging that is very efficient, easy to recycle, easy to open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And something like just in the past year, we have saved 55,000 tons of waste as a result of this program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now started putting solar cells on the roofs of all our fulfillment centers. We’ve done about 15 this year, these are big fulfillment centers, they’re about a million square feet each. So we’re covering them with solar cells and that will cover about 80 percent of the fulfillment center’s energy budget on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy. I don’t know the figure, but it’s something like 3.6 million megawatt hours per year. We’ve built solar farms and solar wind farms. We keep throwing this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a goal long term of being completely renewable, so it will take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is these are not only great for the environment. They’re good business decisions too. The technologies have improved to build a solar farm or a solar wind farm now. These are competitive technologies with natural gas plans, so you can actually do it and feel like you’re making a sensible business decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think a lot of companies will do this in the future. I think they should do it. We’re having fun with all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space-and-blue-origin-3027httpsyoutubelql3tycq1yyt30m27s&quot;&gt;Space and Blue Origin &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LqL3tyCQ1yY?t=30m27s&quot;&gt;30:27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I love space. I have been a space love since I was a five-year old boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I won the lottery with Amazon. I know I won the lottery. And now I’m investing those lottery winnings in Blue Origin, which is the space company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re flying a tourism vehicle, and hopefully start taking people up in 2018. That’s coming right up. We’ve been working on it for more than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This overnight success is taking longer than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also building an orbital vehicle called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Glenn&quot;&gt;New Glenn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Shepard&quot;&gt;New Shepard&lt;/a&gt; is named for Alan Shepard, the first American in space. New Glenn is named after the American hero, John Glenn, who was the first American to orbit the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are reusable boosters, fully reusable. That’s the key to lower the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our vision at Blue Origin is we want people millions of people living and working in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal hope is I live long enough to see kind of the dynamism in space. I want to see the whole economy, the entrepreneurs in space that I got to witness in the last 20 years on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with being an entrepreneur in the space arena is the price of admission is so darn high. To do interesting things in space, the kind of beginning or entry level is a few hundred million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not going to get two kids in their dorm room doing something interesting in space. Whereas that’s literally what happened to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Internet, the price of admission is so low, you can get these amazing experiments. Where one kid in a dorm room does something and it turns into Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or Amazon’s case, I started this with an incredibly small amount of capital and was able to grow because we didn’t need a lot to begin with. The heavy lifting was in place for Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t need to build a transportation network. It existed already. It was the UPS, Royal Mail, US Postal Service, and Deutsche Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have to build a telecommunications backbone to connect with my customers. It was there. It was called the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in fact, the Internet was resting on top of the long distance phone service of that time. You guys remember the dial-up modem. Some of you do. Some of you should go to a museum to see a dial-up modem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently showed a group of youngsters a payphone. I came across one,and I was like, my god guys, come over here. This may be the last one. You have to see it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is Amazon got to rest on top of, we didn’t have to build a payment system. It already existed. It was called the credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers were already on every desk thanks to Microsoft, IBM, and Apple. But what were they being used for? To play games, not to buy things on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all that heavy lifting was in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have such a good feeling if I could be an 80-year-old guy, laying there thinking about my life, and say there is now a bunch of entrepreneurs in space because I took my Amazon lottery winnings and built the infrastructure that does take billions of dollars in CapX to lower the cost to access to space. That’s the way you get millions of people living and working in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, we need that. Those of you that think about the future, at all, you can do a simple calculation. We can argue about limited resources on Earth, so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the calculation that you can’t argue with. That is you take current baseline energy usage on Earth, compound it by just a few percent a year for just a few hundred years, and you have cover the entire Earth in solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to have to decide do we want a society of pioneering, invention, expansion, growth? Or do we want a society of stasis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the Earth is finite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And personally, I don’t believe that stasis is compatible with freedom. For me, that’s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second of all, it’s going to be dull. Stasis is really dull. You don’t want to live in the stasis world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we’re going to get more efficient. For the past hundred years, we’ve been getting more productive, more efficient. That trends is going to continue. But even so, we’re going to way to use more energy. More energy per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, I don’t want to stabilized population. I want there to be a trillion humans in the solar system. With a trillion humans, we’d have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be an incredible system. Don’t you want that dynamism? It would be so much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for your great, great, great grandchildren. What kind of world do you want them to live in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want them to live in that expansive world that is learning more about the universe and expanding out into the solar system. So we have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won so many lotteries in my life. My mom, Jackie, and my dad, Mike. My mom had me when she was 17 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She was still in high school. It was not cool. And she did an amazing job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad, Mike, is a cuban immigrant that came here when he was 16 without his parents. Did an amazing job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are the things that are your little gifts in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My greatest admiration is held for those people who had terrible parents and still somehow made it through. That’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opposite, so I got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That was a fun conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karaswisher&quot;&gt;Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; is a damn good journalist. She’s the co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/&quot;&gt;recode&lt;/a&gt;, went to school to be a spy, and known as the most &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/kara-swisher-silicon-valleys-most-powerful-snoop.html&quot;&gt;well-liked and feared journalist in Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swisher joins &lt;a href=&quot;http://tim.blog/2017/01/26/kara-swisher/&quot;&gt;Tim Ferriss’ podcast&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the skills of a good reporter, her sexuality, parenting, tidbits of interviews with Steve Jobs, and more. This is a short transcription of a few bits I found interesting and useful. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QCKTXLoZh4&quot;&gt;full interview here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills-a-reporter-should-have-610httpsyoutubeqcktxlozh4t6m10s&quot;&gt;Skills a reporter should have &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_QCKTXLoZh4?t=6m10s&quot;&gt;6:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills a reporter should have are persistence. Ability to ask questions. And just an ability to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk about this a little bit. I went to the School of Foreign Intelligence at Georgetown. I was going to be a spy. And I did a lot of scenario building whenever I’m analyzing or thinking about companies or businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often when I’m thinking about what some company is doing or what I want to cover, for example, like Twitter and the sale. It could be anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go, “what would I do. What are those fuckers up to?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s 10 things. There is usually not more than 10 things they could be up to. And I follow every one as if it’s the truth. Then I find the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really pretty easy. And I think reporters are so reactive. Something happens, and then they write it. They tend to type it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They never take a minute to analyze. They never take a minute not to react. They never take a minute to imagine what people are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can almost create your news if you start to get smarter about it. Most reporters literally just react and type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-not-to-care-what-other-people-think-2058httpsyoutubeqcktxlozh4t20m58s&quot;&gt;How not to care what other people think &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_QCKTXLoZh4?t=20m58s&quot;&gt;20:58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this is interesting, I was talking to someone the other day, and they were telling me about how social media informs them too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they said, “I wonder if I’m more influenced by the outside or the inside?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like photos on Facebook or people being happy. We had discussed this issue before, and it’s absolutely true. That’s exactly what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those pictures aren’t real. That’s their best side. That doesn’t mean what’s actually going on. There is lots of unhappiness in there. That’s not true. It’s the photo. It’s not the true thing that is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because I’m a reporter, I know that’s not the real story. When I was a young reporter, I used to think what are people lying to me about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to become a great reporter, what are people lying to themselves about every day? What do they need to lie about to get through every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the stronger thing. I think people do that all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I tell myself the truth a lot. Today I was mad at someone, and I was like, “I’m fucking pissed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people, “oh, don’t be pissed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I tell my sons, my oldest son is a real pleaser. I don’t like it. He’s really worried about what people think. He’s a teenager. I get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was like, “what this errant person thinks about you, 20 years from now, you’re never going to remember that person. It doesn’t matter what they think about you. It’s hard to see into the future, but I promise you what this person thinks about you doesn’t matter even slightly for a second.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I don’t know how you get out of it, but if you start to realize your best instinct is yourself, and then people you really trust, and even people you really trust don’t give you great advice sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you trust in your own self, you can often not feel bad when people come after you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-people-got-wrong-about-steve-jobs-3522httpsyoutubeqcktxlozh4t35m22s&quot;&gt;What people got wrong about Steve Jobs &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_QCKTXLoZh4?t=35m22s&quot;&gt;35:22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one of the things people got wrong about him [Steve Jobs], and you know he was difficult. I didn’t work with him, so I didn’t know. But he definitely had a temper. Had opinions, very strong opinions that could be very cutting. But so did a lot of people. I don’t think he was anymore than anyone else necessarily. He was just more famous, therefore people note it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People would say he’s heartless. I think he had too much heart. You know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cared too much. He had so much heart that he just couldn’t stand it when things weren’t right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started looking at him that way, it made a lot more sense to me. Again, I didn’t know him personally very well. I interviewed him eight or nine, maybe 10 times. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/waltmossberg&quot;&gt;Walt&lt;/a&gt; knew he much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he just had a lot of heart. And it was overwhelming to him. He had a lot of feelings. He never hid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He never pretended he kind of wasn’t an asshole sometimes. I kind of liked that. I like people like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say, “oh he wasn’t as a big of a hero.” I said, “I don’t think he’s a hero. I think he’s fascinating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to like cartoonize people. And not make them complex. Not let them have complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I’m a good reporter is I understand complexity. There is a lot of different personalities at once. I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-make-a-great-live-event-4901httpsyoutubeqcktxlozh4t49m1s&quot;&gt;What make a great live event? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_QCKTXLoZh4?t=49m1s&quot;&gt;49:01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s theater. People don’t think of it as theater. I’m a big theater fan. I used to write a column about theater for the Washington Post on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went from when I was a kid. My mom took me to all kinds of live events, especially Broadway and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-narrative-of-a-conversation-4954httpsyoutubeqcktxlozh4t49m54s&quot;&gt;The narrative of a conversation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_QCKTXLoZh4?t=49m54s&quot;&gt;49:54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot about the narrative of a conversation. I lot of people ask a question, get an answer, ask a question, get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not ask a question, get an answer. I have a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a narrative conversation. It’s storytelling. I ask questions that people don’t expect. Questions that people want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not Oprah-like. And she’s real good. An amazing interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time with Steve Jobs, I think people remember it to this day, he said something right near the end. We did the interview months before he died. It was interesting because you would see him better and worse over the years. One year he has weight on him, and the last year, he was just skeletal. It was sad, but at the same time he had more vibrance than anybody on that stage. That was really striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people when someone is dying or sick, try to pretend that’s not what’s happening. Let’s pretend you’re not very ill here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked two questions that people remembered. I said, “what do you do all day? What’s a Steve Jobs day like?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know. He answered it. It was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I asked, “what are you going to do with the rest of your life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everyone was shocked. Take a breath, that’s insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave a great answer. It was about television. He wanted to change television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so great he had that ambition. Who knows when people are going to die, but he looked very ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he just started coming alive talking about television. He was great. He lived right up until he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about asking the questions people want to know. I think reporters on stage don’t do that. I’m just curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also treat them like people. Not potentates. You know what I mean? I imagine every day they have problems like I do. I treat the president the same way I would a janitor when interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keys-to-good-parenting-for-you-10651httpsyoutubeqcktxlozh4t1h6m51s&quot;&gt;Keys to good parenting for you &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_QCKTXLoZh4?t=1h6m51s&quot;&gt;1:06:51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised, but Megan and I aren’t very hard of them when it comes to school. I find the obsession with school and achievement to be disturbing. We don’t push that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always like, “you don’t need to know that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go for a walk. I want them to go outside more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the obsession of making your life better through your children is really demented. You see it all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The achievement, pushing them when you know full well it doesn’t matter. Most of schooling, doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an argument with one of his teachers recently, they were doing some homework assignment, and I was like, “this is stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agreed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nntaleb&quot;&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb&lt;/a&gt; gives a short introduction to the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc&quot;&gt;antifragility&lt;/a&gt;. This concept is covered in length in Taleb’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680&quot;&gt;Antifragile Thingss That Gain From Disorder&lt;/a&gt;. It’s part of a series of books from Taleb. The others are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493754906&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=fooled+by+randomness&quot;&gt;Fooled by Randomness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493754924&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=black+swan&quot;&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bed-Procrustes-Philosophical-Practical-Aphorisms/dp/0812982401/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1493754940&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=The+Bed+of+Procrustes&quot;&gt;The Bed of Procrustes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This book and interview are difficult to understand. It’s quite the idea and concept, but Taleb knows that too. I’ve found a few great summaries here that can help: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maxmednik.com/home/notes-on-antifragile-by-nassim-nicholas-taleb&quot;&gt;Max Mednik’s extensive notes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nateliason.com/lessons/antifragile/&quot;&gt;notes from Nat Alison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fourminutebooks.com/antifragile-summary/&quot;&gt;four minute book notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-fragility-143httpsyoutube4vbk2xe9zct1m43s&quot;&gt;What is fragility? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=1m43s&quot;&gt;1:43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day looking at a coffee cup, I realized that I may have an interesting definition of fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll get to anti-fragility in a minute, but you need to understand the fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have an interesting definition of fragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fragility is what does not like randomness. What does not like variability. What does not like shocks. What does not like a cluster of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I look at this coffee cup, when I put it on the table, it’s safe on the table. It wants peace and tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized the fragile has some properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we can define fragile that way, does not like some shocks and a few other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what is the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opposite-of-fragile-244httpsyoutube4vbk2xe9zct2m44s&quot;&gt;Opposite of Fragile &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=2m44s&quot;&gt;2:44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m sending a package to South Africa from New York, what do I write on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fragile. Equals, in other words, handle with care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite of such a package would necessarily be something not neutral. Just like the opposite of concave is not linear. The opposite of positive concavity is not linear, it’s negative concavity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the opposite of fragile would not be the equivalent of “hey I don’t care.” It would be something written on it, please mishandle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that gives us a definition of the opposite of the fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples-from-history-349httpsyoutube4vbk2xe9zct3m49s&quot;&gt;3 Examples from History &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=3m49s&quot;&gt;3:49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ancients they had the concept that something like disorder. They used it extensively, they understood it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow with science we lose this ancient wisdom because they’re not formatted in a crisp way with definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had the image of Damocles. I’m sitting here and there is a sword on top of me, nothing good can happen just like the coffee cup. Nothing good can happen, except something bad can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m either going to be neutral, no better off, or worse off. Just like the coffee cup, it can break, but it’s not going to improve from any random event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is Phoenix, the mythical bird. You shoot it, it comes back. You shoot it, it comes back. It’s not going to improve. It’s not going to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the third category, of course, would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRNvoxxSNsY&quot;&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. One head, two grow back. It’s not a good idea to attack it, attacking it will make it a lot stronger. You have to beware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s up to a point. In the Mythology, Hydra was contained by tricks because you always have some vulnerability somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’re always fragile or anti-fragile with respect to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this coffee cup may be more fragile with respect to shocks than it is with respect to heat. It could be the opposite for a plastic coffee cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be much more thermally fragile, but much more robust when it comes to shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;volatility-542httpsyoutube4vbk2xe9zct5m42s&quot;&gt;Volatility &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=5m42s&quot;&gt;5:42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed one thing as an option trader, when you don’t like volatile, when you have a portfolio that is fragile, a 20 percent drop in the market would harm you more than twice than a 10 percent drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is some linearity. There is some class of what we call acceleration. There is an acceleration of the harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, effectively, can allow us to detect fragility. Because everything that is fragile has some non-linearity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tap on this [coffee cup], it doesn’t matter. I increase 10 percent, it breaks. I can tap a thousand times at a certain intensity, doesn’t matter, 10 percent it would break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is effectively a non-linearity that needs to be present everywhere. And I’ve based my research on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;upside-and-downside-633httpsyoutube4vbk2xe9zct6m33s&quot;&gt;Upside and downside &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=6m33s&quot;&gt;6:33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is fragile has to have more downside than upside with respect to random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is anti-fragile will benefit more from variability and necessarily, will have more upside than downside from random shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I fall 10 meters, I’m harmed more than 10 times than if I fell one meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a portfolio that is anti-fragile, a 10 percent move in the market would benefit you a lot more than 10 times a one percent move in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concepts, of course, verbally don’t appear clear. Like anything in science, it’s not very intuitive. It takes some time to work through the points.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Barbara Oakley</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jacob Taylor asks Barbara Oakley &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKa7MCfUpg8&quot;&gt;5 Good Questions&lt;/a&gt;. Barbara has written several books on psychology and learning. I was more interested in some concepts from her book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/&quot;&gt;A Mind for Numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The book centers around how to excel at math or science, but really it’s a book about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/barboakley&quot;&gt;learning how we learn&lt;/a&gt;. There are a lot of useful techniques, here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0ch9l6GcD0&quot;&gt;solid summary&lt;/a&gt;. She touches on several of these in this short interview, and some bits are transcribed below. Watch and listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKa7MCfUpg8&quot;&gt;full interview here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focused-vs-diffused-learning-358httpsyoutubeyka7mcfupg8t3m58s&quot;&gt;Focused vs. Diffused Learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YKa7MCfUpg8?t=3m58s&quot;&gt;3:58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll use the metaphor or analogy of a net. So your brain has a bunch of connections in it. And when you’re operating in it, what I’ll call the focused mode. And that’s when you’ve turned it onto something and you’re focusing, it’s almost the equivalent of using a very tightly woven net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weave is very close, you have very small meshes. And when you think a thought, it’s moving along meshes that have been sort of tread before. Right, those meshes have been used before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re doing multiplication and a multiplication problem, and you’re familiar with that, you’re moving on very familiar concentrated mental patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s say you have to learn something completely new, like division. And you’ve never met that before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the brain has a completely different way of thinking. You have the focused mode, but it has a much more relaxed way of looking at the world. I’ll call it the diffused mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really what that is a bunch of really closely related neuro resting states. Probably the most important of those is the default mode network. And what happens, you can think of it sort of like analogy, is when you’re thinking in this mode, you have a big net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neuro patterns that you’re following are sweeping much more broadly. You can’t hone in and focus on something small and concentrated, but you can at least get to a new place in your brain. A new pattern more easily using this diffuse mode. Where you can later start to hone in and build a more focused mode or way of looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you’re learning something new or trying to figure out a new concept, it’s very important that you focus at first. But then when you feel yourself start to get frustrated and stuck, the more you think about it when you’re in that state, the more you’re kind of tightly boxing yourself into this little part of the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to get your attention completely off it. You can focus on something different or you can go for a walk, take a shower, take a nap. All sorts of things can activate these diffused resting states, which is actually what you need in order to start understanding these new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you’re learning something new, you want to be able to go back and forth between these two different modes. And people often don’t understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say, when I’m focusing is the only time I’m really learning something. And if I stop, I’m giving up. I must not be good. But actually that’s how your brain works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to stop when you’re getting frustrated. And when you’re doing something else, you’re not conscious of it, but you’re doing something else, but your brain is actually working on that material. You’re making progress, you’re just not aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;routines-for-learning-835httpsyoutubeyka7mcfupg8t8m35s&quot;&gt;Routines for learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YKa7MCfUpg8?t=8m35s&quot;&gt;8:35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer a day that has some looseness in the structure. It’s important that you work away on something, but sometimes something will capture your attention and you’ll want to go beyond the minimal time dedicated to it. So I like to do that with my own routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are very comfortable with a good structure. What I would say to them is make sure you’re doing something in that day that’s completely unexpected. Or that’s absolutely irrelevant to what you believe is important to be working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s something I’ve really made a point of doing throughout my life. I think I’ve benefitted from this. There are times in anyone’s life, even if they’re learning something or mastering a competency that’s really difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for me getting my doctorate in systems engineering. That’s not something where I could putz around and do it a couple hours a day. It really took focused attention for quite some time or a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I would always even at the end of the day, you know what, I’m going to read a little bit of history. I’m going to read the National Enquirer. I’m going to do something that is completely unrelated to what I’m studying or supposed to be learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow that even gave me freedom, so I can fall asleep more easily. It was like, oh ok, I’m relaxed now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think it builds a mental flexibility that can be extremely valuable. Some really really smart people that I know, they can think really fast, but they’re utterly inflexible. If you present an idea that’s not their idea, even if it’s a better idea, and quite obviously a better idea - it’s like they’re a race care driver and they’re going down that path and you’ve just said turn sideways and they just can’t do it. They’re not used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some really smart people that practice more flexibility in their thinking, they’re more capable of doing it. And I’d think they all are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interleaving-1127httpsyoutubeyka7mcfupg8t11m27s&quot;&gt;Interleaving &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YKa7MCfUpg8?t=11m27s&quot;&gt;11:27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something called interleaving in learning. And it’s coming more and more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when you’re learning a new set of math techniques. If you’re working on a book in statistics, you might have a chapter, have a part at the end of the chapter with the techniques you’ve learned in that chapter for that section and then your professor might assign 10 problems of that type to kind of burn it into you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually what that does is after you’ve done the first couple, you’re just mimicking yourself. So what you want to be doing in all of learning, which is never presented this way or very rarely at high schools or universities, is do a couple problems of one type and then find something that’s different. And see what the difference is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then interleave back to where you were. And by doing this, when you take a final in a class, that’s what you’re really seeing - an interleaving of all sorts of different things at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why people can often do well in a class, and flub on a final. They’re not used to teaching themselves to be flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think it’s like that in life. If you set yourself up, so you’re studying one subject, but then you switch to something really dramatically different sometime during the day, I think that helps with the ability to quickly transition to one thought to another thought. That in turn, can help you combine really interesting thoughts in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-and-bad-study-habits-2450httpsyoutubeyka7mcfupg8t24m50s&quot;&gt;Good and bad study habits &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YKa7MCfUpg8?t=24m50s&quot;&gt;24:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elmore Leonard did this 10 rules of writing. So I thought, how about 10 rules of studying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I thought more, and said what about 10 rules of good studying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then 10 rules of bad studying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got that up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgi.stanford.edu/~dept-ctl/tomprof/posting.php?ID=1346&quot;&gt;my website now&lt;/a&gt; and it’s in the book. And there are a lot of ways to study horrifically. I’ve probably done them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways, for example, when you’re reading a book and you really want to understand it. The best way to do it, especially if it’s difficult, is look at that page and if you want to, annotate something on the margins because that helps you better neurology encode the key idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what you’re trying to do, is pick out the key idea. And another good way is to look away, and see if you can recall the main ideas you just read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just cheated and told you some good techniques. But I wanted to contrast that with what people normally do, which is you move the pen on the page and you underline or highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And somehow this motion makes you think you’re moving it. And it’s not. In fact, excessive highlighting has been found to be very ineffective. Re-reading is very ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is sort of a mantra amongst professors of doing concept maps where you pick a concept and map it and connect it with other things. Well guess what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not as effective as simply recalling the material as well. So those are bad ways to study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to always to try to recall the main points. Often, we discount the importance of memorization. And memorization can be an important part of any expertise because you need to have information in your long term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never want to discount the importance of that’s a really important equation, I think I’m going to treat it like a poem and memorize it, so I can understand all the components more deeply. Why should we let the poets have all the fun with memorization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-importance-of-sleep-2740httpsyoutubeyka7mcfupg8t27m40s&quot;&gt;The importance of sleep &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YKa7MCfUpg8?t=27m40s&quot;&gt;27:40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough sleep is a really common way to study very badly. Because sleep of course is when new synaptic connections are growing. If you study, then sleep, you actually wake up smarter and you’ve got more connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you can block off, so you do a study session during the day, and then sleep, and then another short study session and sleep, you’re actually building a really nice infrastructure. But if you block it all at the end, your brain can only grow so many new synaptic connections. So you’re just kind of creating a puddle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shep Gordon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shep Gordon joins the &lt;a href=&quot;http://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/shep-gordon-supermensch-maui-episode-544/&quot;&gt;Art of Charm podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Shep discusses life lessons from his book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/They-Call-Supermensch-Backstage-Rock-2019n-2019Roll-ebook/dp/B00MMFN8QY&quot;&gt;They Call Me Supermensch&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven’t seen the documentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Supermensch-The-Legend-of-Shep-Gordon/70292993&quot;&gt;Supermensch&lt;/a&gt;, you’re missing out. It’s full of fantastic stories and it’s incredibly entertaining.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shep is known as the manager of Alice Cooper, Teddy Pendergrass, Luther Vandross, and many more. He’s the godfather of the celebrity chef movement, and has worked with several world class chefs like Roger Vergé and Emeril Lagasse. The full podcast is almost 2 hours long, so this transcription is only bits and pieces of the conversation. Listen to it in its entirety &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-yes-takes-time-843httpsyoutubebcnp4wpuqt8m43s&quot;&gt;A “yes” takes time &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ?t=8m43s&quot;&gt;8:43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve always told my clients is I can get you a “no” very fast. A “yes”, I can’t tell you how long it’s going to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I sort of set my targets on meeting someone, I’m able to sort of find the path usually to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-its-important-to-be-a-groupie-1303httpsyoutubebcnp4wpuqt13m3s&quot;&gt;Why it’s important to be a groupie &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ?t=13m3s&quot;&gt;13:03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be a fan of other humans. So many people, the world is six inches from their nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can really appreciate what another person has done, and want to get to them and say thank you, and maybe have some of what you’re attracted to bleed off into you, that’s a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;serve-other-people-3952httpsyoutubebcnp4wpuqt39m52s&quot;&gt;Serve other people &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ?t=39m52s&quot;&gt;39:52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, one of the hardest things to get through my brain and one of the most rewarding things to get through my brain was the people that I was attracted to, Roger Vergé and his holiness [the Dalai Lama], their happiness came from serving others. That was there real joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words are the words. That’s the hardest concept to get through your brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most selfish thing that you can possibly do is serve other people. Because it makes you so happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what both of them really taught to me, and I try to live my life by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-he-made-the-paparazzi-happy-4150httpsyoutubebcnp4wpuqt39m52s&quot;&gt;How he made the paparazzi happy &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ?t=39m52s&quot;&gt;41:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of it is attitude. If you come in angry, you usually leave angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so obvious to me that the interest of the star, and the interest of the paparazzi, were the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what star you are, you have a PR person who is looking to spin good stuff about you. You have a movie coming out, a record come out, your new restaurant opens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no celebrity who is important enough for the paparazzi to care about, that doesn’t make their livelihood off press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the two of them meet at exactly the same place. The problem was nobody was talking to them to say, be of mutual interest to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I live on a small island. There are very few paparazzi. I know all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said, if I tell you someone is coming in, you don’t take any random shots. They’ll set up a photo session for you, you’ll get the only shot, give half the money to the food bank here on Maui and keep the other half. Everybody is happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what we do. You get control, the picture that you want. It helps your career. The food bank gets money, feeds a lot of homeless people. Paparazzi guy doesn’t have to sneak around bushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve invited them [paparazzi] to dinner. I’ve invited them to Tom Arnold’s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t be a public figure, and lie to yourself that you don’t want attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;handshakes--contracts-5029httpsyoutubebcnp4wpuqt50m29s&quot;&gt;Handshakes &amp;gt; contracts &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ?t=50m29s&quot;&gt;50:29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contracts make lawsuits. Handshakes make friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-shortcuts-and-the-key-to-luck-11214httpsyoutubebcnp4wpuqt1h12m14s&quot;&gt;No shortcuts and the key to luck &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ?t=1h12m14s&quot;&gt;1:12:14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to get what you want is to wake up earlier, go to sleep later, and do more work in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people that I’ve seen that have shortcuts in their lives, the damage of those shortcuts is almost insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being born to wealthy. Being born to really powerful parents, who know they’re powerful and don’t back off it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning a lottery. Not working for these fool’s gold items. They are fool’s gold stuff. And if you don’t work for them, that’s what you actually think life is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not about the work and the journey to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just so hard to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where when you get up and work for it, you understand that accumulating more money than the next guy is not going to make you happy. Accumulating enough to eat can make you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s getting up earlier, working harder, that’s all part of it. Whether it’s working at a relationship or working at business or working for something that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the key to success, that to me, is the key to luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ability-to-fail-11401httpsyoutubebcnp4wpuqt1h14m1s&quot;&gt;Ability to fail &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_BcnP4WP_uQ?t=1h14m1s&quot;&gt;1:14:01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a business of service and particularly a high profile business, the ability to fail is more important than the ability to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing gets done alone. Almost everything is in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing for my relationships with my artists was having the ability to fail. Because if you’re not willing to fail, you’re not going to do anything worthwhile. You’re going to do what everyone else did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-next-celebrity-job&quot;&gt;What’s the next celebrity job?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s the grower’s of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I try to look for is waves? Cultural waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t a genius with the chefs. It was so obvious. You could be on the 50-yard line at a football game, you could be in the front row of a Broadway theater if you had enough money, and you couldn’t get into Le Cirque. You couldn’t get into Charlie Trotter’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so obvious that demand was there. Demand is what drives celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is the revolution. And it’s exactly like the chef’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny, when I started with the chefs, Chef Boyardee was the famous cook. In the pot world, it’s Bob Marley or Snoop Dogg. Not the actual grower, who is the real star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Chef Boyardee against Emeril. Snoop Dogg against the grower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that has a real possibility to develop. They’ll [growers] will become media stars out of it, become heroes out of it. The economics are gigantic, so they’ll be able to fuel the fire just like the chefs did by hiring PR people.&lt;/p&gt;

Karen has co-authored a couple books, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Will-Measure-Your-Life/dp/0062102419/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1476306415&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=how+to+measure+your+life&quot;&gt;How to Measure Your Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062565230&quot;&gt;Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice&lt;/a&gt;, with Clayton Christensen and others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first 8 minutes or so of the talk wasn’t all that new to me. It includes some dynamite anecdotes from How to Measure Your Life, like the job-to-be-done of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jobstobedone.org/radio/unpacking-the-progress-making-forces-diagram/&quot;&gt;dining room table via Bob Moesta&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of the transcription is from the second half of the talk, and has more examples from the newest book Competing Against Luck. Jobs-to-be-done is a fascinating theory, and Karen really presents it way that keeps you curious. Watch or listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9jrKqZutM&quot;&gt;full talk here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Playstation 4. Who do you think is Sony’s biggest competitor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly Xbox. It’s what almost always gets mentioned. I remember two or three years ago they were both coming out with different versions and in the paper, you could see side-by-side comparisons of the price, all the features and benefits, who was doing better in the Christmas sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what world is this a competitor of Playstation? [&lt;em&gt;shows a photo of bottles of wine is showing&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mine it is. Or this? [&lt;em&gt;shows a photo of ice cream&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are competing to be hired by me or you to help me relax after a stressful day of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t even know what you’re competing with, how can you be the superior offering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not just competing with the traditional offerings of things because people are hiring you, your product or service, to fulfill a job to be done in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-definition-of-a-job-931httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt9m31s&quot;&gt;The definition of a job &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=9m31s&quot;&gt;9:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have a very specific definition of a job. It’s not just intended to be a cute term or a generic term for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think jobs are specifically the progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you have to understand, both the progress they’re trying to make and the circumstance to innovate successfully for that job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-and-emotional-dimensions-955httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt9m55s&quot;&gt;Social and emotional dimensions &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=9m55s&quot;&gt;9:55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s critical is they don’t just have functional dimensions. It’s not just trying to get something done functionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very important social and emotional dimensions as well. You’ve all hired this conference for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it probably has social and emotional dimensions that are quite important that are far beyond the function of I want to be in a conference room all day learning about development and in-house lawyering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you feel when you see a doctor’s examination room? [&lt;em&gt;shows photo of examination room&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s perfectly functional. It has everything the doctor needs to quickly come in and examine you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social and emotional components of the job-to-be-done here are far more significant than the functional ones. No patient would ever design a room like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sit on the crinkly paper, you already feel kind of vulnerable and anxious. The windows are closed already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hear people walking outside the door in sort of hush tones, are they coming, and you’re sort of sitting in the johnny. You feel vulnerable. This room makes people feel vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would never design this room from scratch, if you were thinking about the job-to-be-done from the patient’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked to the head of innovation at a huge health care chain in America, called Intermountain Healthcare. And he had overseen dozens and dozens of innovation projects in his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said until the moment he sat on the table like that as a patient, he was preparing for knee surgery, it hadn’t occurred to him that the innovations that he created (software) would have emotional and social components as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between having a doctor turn away from you to type into a computer and a doctor keeping eye contact with you the whole time are enormous to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiny gestures that connect with people emotionally at a moment when they’re feeling vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs-to-be-done aren’t just functional. They’re social and emotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;airbnb-example-1203httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt12m03s&quot;&gt;Airbnb example &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=12m03s&quot;&gt;12:03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate an unusual job to be done, this is an air mattress [&lt;em&gt;shows photo&lt;/em&gt;] in a spare room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who on earth would say this competes with hotels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not better than a hotel room. You will not be surprised when I say Airbnb, which in December, was given a $24 billion valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because Airbnb, at least in the beginning, isn’t competing with hotels. People hire an Airbnb for very different reasons than they would a hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m staying in an Airbnb for this trip to London. There is no reason, you could guess by my demographic or me standing here with what I’m wearing, why would I choose an Airbnb when I could’ve stayed in this beautiful hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social and emotional. I used to live in London. I don’t like to feel like a tourist when I come back to a place I used to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to stay in my old neighborhood. I want my kids, who are with me, to be able to see their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Airbnb is certainly not nicer than this hotel, but the far more important dimensions I was hiring for were social and emotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workarounds-and-nonconsumption-1310httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt13m10s&quot;&gt;Workarounds and nonconsumption &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=13m10s&quot;&gt;13:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do you find jobs-to-be-done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds great, but how do I see them? How do I recognize when people are trying to solve something in their lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You look for what people are struggling to accomplish. And you often see it with crazy workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or nonconsumption, choosing to do nothing rather than hire something that is inadequate for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think back to our condo buyers. People did not move homes even though it was far less work to be a retired person in a beautiful condo unit with a clubhouse and a pool, all the things you get from a condo association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonconsumption. I’d rather suffer with what I have than choose something that doesn’t really solve the job-to-be-done for me better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workarounds. People doing crazy things to solve problems should be a real clue to you that there is an opportunity to innovate something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for struggles. People are struggling to make progress in their lives. Personally or professionally, and you can help them solve those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quickbooks-example-1426httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt14m26s&quot;&gt;Quickbooks Example &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=14m26s&quot;&gt;14:26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The co-founder of Intuit, Scott Cook, told me that for four years they ignored the fact that many of their customers told them that they were jerry-rigging Quicken, the personal financial software, to use for their small business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He just thought they were people that were cheap or people who didn’t want to look for the very sophisticated accounting software that was on the market. Because what was on the market seemed very good to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so sophisticated it created books almost like a professional accountant would for you. But for four years they didn’t pay attention that constantly people said they were doing this crazy workaround with Quicken to use it for their small business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until it finally clicked, the job-to-be-done for many people is not to create sophisticated books that look like an accountant did it. The job-to-be-done is I don’t want to have to do this at all. I don’t want this to be hard. I want to make sure money comes in and money goes out. I don’t want to have to hire someone to do it. The job-to-be-done is to make this as painless as possible for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Scott Cook’s quote to me, “half the functionality, twice the price.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the market leader just a few months after launching and continued to be so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, what Intuit is working on now, they’re so focused in on the job-to-be-done for their customers, they’re working on the form you fill out for TurboTax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year they would add questions to the TurboTax form. Chapters, I think they called them depending on what level of taxes you were trying to file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And every year they were trying the perfect combination of questions to ask to generate perfect tax returns. And they got longer and longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started thinking again, what is the job-to-be-done for these taxes or tax returns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job-to-be-done is I don’t want to have to do my taxes. I don’t want to sit there and put in a 100 answers to 100 questions. That’s very stressful for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes me anxious, what if I make a mistake. The job-to-be-done is make my taxes done without having to make me worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now they have a big hairy audacious goal to do taxes before people without them having to put that information in. That’s crazy. How do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, guess what, they’re starting down the path of figuring out how do we get permissions from the paystubs, the companies that send the paychecks. How do we get permissions to get access to your investments and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we auto-populate this information for you, so you start with something that is closer than being done and we can minimize the questions for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is, and I think they might get there, is make this job-to-be-done easy for me. The progress I want to make is I don’t want to be stressed out about my taxes. I want them to be accurate and I want them to be filed on time, and I don’t want to do them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re on their way because they have focused on the job-to-be-done not the functionality of their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;medtronic-1720httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt17m20s&quot;&gt;Medtronic &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=17m20s&quot;&gt;17:20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the job-to-be-done is removing obstacles from people who are trying to make progress doing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are actually pictures from a company called Medtronic, a medical device company, that makes pacemakers among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they were trying to introduce pacemakers into their Indian market, which should, sadly, be a really ripe market for pacemakers because of the prevalence of heart disease. But not many people were getting pacemakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They created fabulous pacemakers and the doctors who implanted them thought they were terrific. But it turned out for the people getting the pacemakers, it was an overwhelming thing to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I navigate the medical system for the pacemaker? A lot of it’s personal payment, how do I get the money to do the pacemaker? How do I navigate through the various hospitals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Medtronic focused not on the pacemaker itself, it was a superior product, but how do we remove the obstacles for both doctors and patients to getting these pacemakers in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did things like setup free community clinics where people could come and be diagnosed to whether or not they were at least a candidate for it. Compared to some of the doctor visits people traditionally have which would be 30 seconds or a minute, and a pacemaker would never come up in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they created free clinics. They created positions in the hospital, they called Sherpas, where the Sherpas job was to help people navigate the system. From the financial aspect of it to the medical care before, during, and after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They took away the anxiety of people who were trying to decide whether or not the pacemaker would save their life, or in the case of a lot of the patients their family’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out families felt incredibly responsible for their elders. And they wanted to make sure they had the money, so their elders always have the opportunity to get a pacemaker if it would be better for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found ways that had nothing to do with the innovation itself to make it more successful by removing the obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-be-more-innovatve-1923httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt19m23s&quot;&gt;How can you be more innovatve? [19:23](https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=19m23s]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I ask you again, from this perspective, how can you be more innovative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really haven’t talked about technology at all. Yes, the Intuit product is a software product, but most of what I’m talking about has nothing to do with the skills to be able to program something or create something high-tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s understanding people and the progress they’re trying to make in its full functional, emotional, and social components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That probably changes things from your perspective dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-progress-1955httpsyoutube3a9jrkqzutmt19m55s&quot;&gt;Make progress &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3a9jrKqZutM?t=19m55s&quot;&gt;19:55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help me make progress. Think about your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are lots of ways people are trying to hire you in their department to try to help them make progress. And they’re probably not all or even primarily functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re looking for emotional and social jobs-to-be-done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does your CEO hire you to give definitive, perfect, legal advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does he hire you, so he can sleep well at night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does he hire you because he doesn’t want to be the person second-guessing everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does he or she hire you, so they won’t go over the edge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they hire you because you’re the truth teller?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to know the answer to that question if you’re going to be effective at your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can innovate in 100 ways that have nothing to do with a keyboard if you understand the progress people around you are trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gordon Livingston</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gordon Livingston was a psychiatrist and author who wrote several books on being human. This transcription is a conversation related to his book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Too-Soon-Old-Late-Smart/dp/1569243735&quot;&gt;Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hosted by Dan Rodricks on WYPR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Livingston passed away in March of 2016. He had some incredible life experiences, and listening to him or reading his books makes you feel smarter than you already are. You can find the &lt;a href=&quot;http://programs.wypr.org/podcast/too-soon-old-too-late-smart-wednesday-august-15-12-1-pm&quot;&gt;audio of the conversation here&lt;/a&gt; and check out some great notes on this book from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book/30TrueThings&quot;&gt;Derek Sivers here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pursuit-of-happiness-700&quot;&gt;Pursuit of Happiness 7:00&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not taught. I think it should be taught. A subject in all high schools, the pursuit of happiness. People think about personality characteristics. What works for relationships, what doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What virtues do we want to see in the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can only do a little amount of planning. We can assume we want to pursue certain professions, and that changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But being able to evaluate other people, and being able to be honest with ourselves, where our strengths and weakness lie, is an essential human characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re not very good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;components-of-happiness-1014&quot;&gt;3 Components of Happiness 10:14&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are 3 components of happiness. There is &lt;strong&gt;what we’re doing&lt;/strong&gt;. What we’re doing in the way of work, meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone to love&lt;/strong&gt;. And &lt;strong&gt;something to look forward to&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have those 3 things, it’s really hard to be unhappy. So in the lives of unhappy people, one or more of those is commonly missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-bad-things-happen-quickly-1926&quot;&gt;Only Bad Things Happen Quickly 19:26&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, change is a slow process. That’s why I point out, it’s the bad things in life that happen quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awful diagnosis from your doctor or an accident of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that are good in life, that is forming relationships, education, succeeding in our jobs - all those things take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re an impatient culture. People often find that they don’t really want to put in the time and effort to make fundamental changes in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;person-that-cares-the-least-3216&quot;&gt;Person that Cares the Least 32:16&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who works with a person whose marriage is in trouble, will usually discover that one half of the couple is more distressed than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the person who is least distressed is the one who is in control of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I do point out when I see it. Because the person who cares the most is often at whit’s end about what to do. They’re the ones who are pushing for the marriage counseling and they’re the ones invested in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the other person is not, the person who really cares feels powerless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgiveness-3628&quot;&gt;Forgiveness 36:28&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of forgiveness is giving up a grievance that we’re entitled to. That’s not an easy thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes we can’t imagine doing it until the moment that we do it. But it’s essential to living any sort of happy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’re going to be constantly confronted with things that are unsatisfying to us or mistakes often that we’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with the all the forms of forgiveness, I think self-forgiveness is in some ways the most difficult, but the most essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Gordon. It’s essential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Miki Agrawal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twinmiki&quot;&gt;Miki Agrawal&lt;/a&gt; wrote the book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Do-Cool-Sh-Business-Happily/dp/0062366858/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1428968871&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=do+cool+sh+t&quot;&gt;Do Cool Sh*t&lt;/a&gt;. This is a short transcription of jam-packed advice on starting a business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miki has a direct, no nonsense approach. Her stories are powerful and eye-opening. The video is super high-energy and full of quick, actionable advice. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWUcQcXyQp4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;purpose-031httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t31s&quot;&gt;Purpose &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=31s&quot;&gt;0:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose is your best motivation. If you’re starting a business to make money. It’s not going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re starting a business that has a purpose, you can stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-sucks-in-my-world-105httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t1m5s&quot;&gt;What sucks in my world? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=1m5s&quot;&gt;1:05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I break it down in 3 sort of steps when I think about starting a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is what sucks in my world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was traveling to South Africa, I met a young girl on a weekday. I was like you’re 12 years old, it’s a weekday, why aren’t you in school?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she said it’s my week of shame. She proceeded to tell me when she has her period she uses old dirty rags and leaves or whatever she can find, it doesn’t work, she ran home from school crying and eventually she stopped going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then came home to find over 100 million girls are missing from school when they have their period. What sucked in my world is I knew a girl wasn’t going to school or missing school because of her period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-it-suck-for-more-than-just-me-140httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t1m40s&quot;&gt;Does it suck for more than just me? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=1m40s&quot;&gt;1:40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question is does it suck for more than just me. It sucks for more than 2 billion girls right now because that’s the number of women on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means there is a business there. Can we take what we know, a pair of underwear, and put special technology in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for every pair of underwear sold, we fund 7 reusable cloth pads that goes to a girl in a developing world, so she can go back to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passion-158httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t1m58s&quot;&gt;Passion &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=1m58s&quot;&gt;1:58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And third, can I be passionate about this for a really, really long time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So truly think about it. Can I give up everything in business for this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer is no, then keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer is yes, then go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eliminate-depleters-208httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t2m08s&quot;&gt;Eliminate Depleters &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=2m08s&quot;&gt;2:08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first thing you do is you eliminate negative relationships in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are the naysayers. The family members that say stay at your safe job. I call that depleters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if they want the best for you, it’s depleting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not surrounding yourself with the most inspiring and supportive people, then you’re going to be chipping away and second guessing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iterate-228httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t2m28s&quot;&gt;Iterate &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=2m28s&quot;&gt;2:28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best advice I ever received is iteration is profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put something out in the world that’s not absolutely perfect, but you’ll still be able to get feedback and iterate and improve and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create something quickly. Create a minimum viable product, MVP, and just put it out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then just see the response, and keep adjusting and keep iterating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-help-you-248httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t2m48s&quot;&gt;How can I help you? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=2m48s&quot;&gt;2:48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re first starting out something, when you’re first launching an idea, wanting to grow a business, and you need seek advice from people - oh, I want to pick your brain, I don’t know how many times I’ve gotten that - that’s just not going to a work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re going to be like, ugh, another person wants to pick my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you starting by leading with how can I help you versus how can you help me, watch how doors will open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-success-305httpsyoutubeqwucqcxyqp4t3m05s&quot;&gt;Defining Success &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=3m05s&quot;&gt;3:05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came out of college, I had so much student loan debt. So financial freedom was my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I became financially free, my definition of success changed to freedom of time. To be able to do what I want to do when I want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s super important. The freedom of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now that I have freedom of time, my definition of success changed to living to my full potential, which means I can impact as many people as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks, Miki.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Omar Zenhom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Omar Zenhom shares a quick review of Edward de Bono’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Six-Thinking-Hats-Edward-Bono/dp/0316178314&quot;&gt;Six Thinking Hats&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://100mba.net/show/&quot;&gt;$100 MBA podcast&lt;/a&gt;. The framework presented by de Bono is practical and useful when making decisions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listen to Zenhom’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/businessrepublic/mba408-must-read-the-six-thinking-hats-by-edward-de-bono&quot;&gt;15 minute review here&lt;/a&gt;, and check out a short transcription and graphic below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-framework-240&quot;&gt;Why the Framework? 2:40&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Edward de Bono explains in his book, thinking is the ultimate human resource. Yet, we can never be satisfied with our most important skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how good we become, we should always want to be better. Usually the only people who are satisfied with their thinking skills are those who are poor thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Edward de Bono makes it very clear at the start of the book that the purpose of thinking is not to prove yourself right to your own satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That encourages you to have a limited view. And shuts you off from options that may be better than the current one you’re taking advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difficulty of thinking is confusion. People get overwhelmed. People get confused. They don’t know how to organize their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making a decision, there’s many options. Many ways to go about these options. They are so many things that come into play like emotions, information, logic, hope, creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this surrounds us when we’re making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book organizes the different ways you think. The different ways you make decisions. And allows you to see through each filter before you make a final decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it allows us to conduct our thinking as conductors. Somebody who is in control of the way we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we take a moment to think about things in specific ways, in this book six defined ways, it’s a lot easier to think clearly about a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re less likely to get overwhelmed and more confident in the decision we make at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-white-hat-416&quot;&gt;The White Hat 4:16&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each thinking hat has a color. And each color represents a different way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hat is the white hat. The white hat is neutral. It’s objective. The white hat is concerned with objective facts and figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hat is you thinking in the way. So when you wear the white hat, you’re very neutral and very objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re just looking at the facts in front of you. You’re making decisions based on reality, on things you can actually prove are correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-red-hat-450&quot;&gt;The Red Hat 4:50&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red hat suggests anger or seeing red. Rage or extreme emotion or extreme passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red hat gives the emotional point of view. Again this isn’t bad, it just is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-black-hat-504&quot;&gt;The Black Hat 5:04&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black hat is somber and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might say the black hat is a bit cynical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-yellow-hat-515&quot;&gt;The Yellow Hat 5:15&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yellow hat is sunny. It’s positive. The yellow hat is optimistic. It’s full of hope and positive thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a lot of ways, the yellow hat and the black hat are sort of opposites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-green-hat-529&quot;&gt;The Green Hat 5:29&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green as in grass, vegetation, abundance. Or fertile growth, let’s say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green hat indicates creativity and new ideas. Children often wear the green hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re always growing, they’re always thinking. They’re saying why not. They’re going for things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-blue-hat-546&quot;&gt;The Blue Hat 5:46&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blue hat is cool. Not cool as in awesome. Cool as in chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also the color of the sky, which is above everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blue hat is concerned with control. The organization of the thinking process and the use of the other hats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I use these other hats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-benefits-of-this-framework-746&quot;&gt;Top Benefits of This Framework 7:46&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one it allows you to come to a decision and say things with minimal risk because you’ve gone through all the different ways you can think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number two it creates an awareness that gives you multiple perspectives on an issue that you might have. Whether that’s a challenge or disagreement in your business. It helps you understand the other people that disagree with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number three it provides a convenient mechanize for switching gears, from going from one way of thinking to another in a deliberate way. You have these defined ways of going about thinking about this issue, challenge or decision using my red hat, using my black hat. How do I see things now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number four it organizes the way you think about something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And number five, which is probably the biggest takeaway I got from the book, is it helps you as an individual to expand your thinking capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adopting other perspectives that aren’t necessarily your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important for you to be a well-rounded leader. You’re going to be leading different kinds of people, different kinds of opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t just see things in your way. You have to see things in everybody’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’ll be able to communicate with them in a better way if you can see things from their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-example-1149&quot;&gt;An Example 11:49&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick example is when hiring someone new. I take a look at their experience, their attitude, how the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think about hiring or not hiring through these six thinking hats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ll look at it through a white hat perspective. I’ll look at the information on the resumes. The actual facts and figures. What have they done in the past that will prove they’ll be good at this position?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll then take a look at it with my red hat on. How do I feel about this person? Were they friendly? Did I get a good vibe on the actual interview? Do I like them? Do I actually want to spend time with them as a colleague?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll look at the situation with my black hat on. I’m looking for faults now. They’re about a minute late, two minutes late on that Skype call. Does that matter? There was a typo in their email to me the second time around. So I’m looking through that hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I’ll put on my yellow hat. And be more optimistic. Take a look at who referred this person. This is a great person that referred them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And given the circumstance they were nervous on this interview, they did an amazing job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll put my green hat on. Does this person have potential to grow? 
To expand? To become even better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I put my blue hat on and look at all the different hats at the same time. And I evaluate. How do I feel about it after I’ve gone through that whole situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend about two to three solid minutes thinking about this decision with each hat. And now that I’ve gone through that cycle, I can say, you know what, I should hire this person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because as I’ve went through this exercise, I think they’d be a good fit. That it will be a better decision to hire them than not to hire them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/2n182D463u3W0i2Y2o3D/Image%202016-03-28%20at%201.30.07%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;six-thinking-hats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks, Omar and Edward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beth Dunn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bethdunn&quot;&gt;Beth Dunn&lt;/a&gt; shares how to use your words. You’ve likely heard her 10 tips before. But Beth really explains these in detail with techniques on how and why to do these things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She believes we don’t spend enough time thinking about how we sound. We only think about why we want to say. Check out the excerpt below and 10 tips at the bottom of this post. Watch the talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZJ-fL623Ic&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-youll-be-seen-by-others-115httpsyoutubehzj-fl623ict1m15s&quot;&gt;How You’ll Be Seen By Others &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HZJ-fL623Ic?t=1m15s&quot;&gt;1:15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anyone else, I would say it was my grandmother who taught me to say please. It was my grandmother who taught me to say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was the one to tell me to excuse myself when I’m getting up from the dining room table. To say may I instead of can I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anyone else at that age, it was my grandmother who taught me that the way that I choose my words and use my words determines how I’ll be seen by other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-sound-431httpsyoutubehzj-fl623ict4m31s&quot;&gt;How we sound &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HZJ-fL623Ic?t=4m31s&quot;&gt;4:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business, we spend so much time and energy thinking about what it is we want to say. What do we want to say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have committee meetings about this, meetings and emails. What do we want to say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t spend nearly enough time thinking about how we sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contractions-902httpsyoutubehzj-fl623ict9m02s&quot;&gt;Contractions &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HZJ-fL623Ic?t=9m02s&quot;&gt;9:02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single most effective that I have found that is probably the first thing I do with any piece of writing I get is I fix stuff like this: I cannot, it does not, you will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the bad habits that we’ve all fallen into. When we think we have to say something important about ourselves, we suddenly affect this formal, stilted language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we do that? We think it sounds more impressive. So the best thing you can do with any piece of writing you want to make sound more human, sound less like a robot, is use more contractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start bashing words together like you’re at the freaking roller derby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-small-words-1057httpsyoutubehzj-fl623ict10m57s&quot;&gt;Use Small Words &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HZJ-fL623Ic?t=10m57s&quot;&gt;10:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another subtle bad habit. It’s these unnecessarily fancy words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to call us out on it in this room. We are prime offenders in the business community. And yes, in the marketing and sales community, and in the Inbound community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use utilize and employ and leverage, when a simpler word will do. Not just as well, but better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying one use of utilize or one use of leverage will make you seem like some sort of crook, but they have a cumulative affect overtime of suggesting to the reader that you have something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little bit extra razzle-dazzle that suggests to the reader that there is some smoke and mirrors going on here. There is too much icing and not enough cake. What if there is no actual cake here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear, simple, concise language. More Hemingway. Less Shakespeare. Actually makes you seem more honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why the next thing you do is start shortening your words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see words like utilize, employ, and leverage and go for the simpler, shorter, clearer word. Did you know that a synonym for each of these words is use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is literally no shade of meaning lost between the word utilize and use. There is no even a little bit of difference in the definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leverage at least has something of a connotation. I would argue unless you’re talking about taking a big stick and moving a disproportionate mass, there is a physical definition of what leverage means. And 90 percent of the time when you see it, you just mean use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So say use. Not just because I said it was a good idea. Not because I’m some sort of a grammar queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I want you to seem like you’re more honest in your writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exclamations-1324httpsyoutubehzj-fl623ict13m24s&quot;&gt;Exclamations &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HZJ-fL623Ic?t=13m24s&quot;&gt;13:24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a really common thing. We want people to get excited about what we’re offering them. An announcement. An email. A sales pitch. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to stoke the fires of enthusiasm in the hearts of our readers. And what do we use to try and achieve that goal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exclamation marks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the time we use exclamation marks because we want to make our readers excited. Do you know what this actually does? The undermining effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really Just makes you look like you’re kinda new at this game. This whole wordsmithing game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would urge you to try this exercise. Go through one piece of your writing, especially email. You have some email in your stable right now that has an exclamation mark or two in the subject line or in the greeting littered throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just go through that email and take out all the exclamation marks and replace them with periods. And see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you would say now my writing sounds emotionless and flat. And I would say to you, good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this exposes the weakness that was in your writing all along. Now you know the truth and you have a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have some place to start. You have to beef up those words. Punctuation in general, not just exclamation points, are uniquely badly suited to convey emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what’s great at that? Words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words and language are built for it. Exclamation marks can’t bear the weight of human emotion. Words do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So strip away the exclamation marks and beef up your words and let them carry the meaning that you’re trying to convey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will, single handedly, level up your writing to heights that you couldn’t imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoid-jargon-1604httpsyoutubehzj-fl623ict16m04s&quot;&gt;Avoid Jargon &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HZJ-fL623Ic?t=16m04s&quot;&gt;16:04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the thing we do that undermines this effort in our writing? We use jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can actually physically hear some of you rolling your eyes. Because this is one of the most common things that you’ll see in those listicle blog posts about how to be a better writer. Don’t use jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’re like yeah I know, use smaller words. Don’t use jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I specifically want to call us out on, again I’m a prime offender on this and I think we here in this room are particularly bad on this count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain type of jargon that we all fall into a bad habit of using are these acronyms. Yeah, we love our acronyms in marketing don’t we.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CTA. ROI. DFUI. STFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do they even mean? We in this room know what a lot of those mean. And we love to use them. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it’s like a secret handshake. It’s membership in a club. This Inbound club. And what is Inbound? Except one great big tribal gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I love it. I love being a member of this community and these secret handshakes, and these inside jokes we tell each other. But in our marketing and sales communications this is the last thing we want to do. Is have a secret handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s slamming the door in the face of your readers. It’s saying you don’t belong. You can’t sit with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t think that’s what we want to get across. So I would urge you to pull apart as many of these acronyms as you reasonably can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again this isn’t an absolutist stance. Define them and define them a little bit longer than you think you should. Not because I’m a rules person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I think you would want to appear more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those thousand paper cuts effect. A little bit of this doesn’t hurt you, but overtime it makes you seem less helpful to your reader if you don’t define these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-your-pronouns-2712httpsyoutubehzj-fl623ict27m12s&quot;&gt;Check Your Pronouns &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/HZJ-fL623Ic?t=27m12s&quot;&gt;27:12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to be seen as people who care about our readers. This is vital. I care about you. I’m here for you. I’m focused on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check your pronouns. I don’t mean gender. Although that is an important thing to focus on as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that is undermining you in your desire to want to be seen as someone who cares about your reader is not whether or not you’re using he or she as much whether you’re using crap like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to announce. We value your feedback. We’re working hard to bring you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who cares? You’re leading off each one of those sentences with me, I, and we. And you’re putting the spotlight on yourself and not on your reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re talking about your emotional state. I don’t care about your emotional state or you’re excited about what you’re announcing. I’m your reader. Tell me why I should care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I say check your pronouns, if you want to look less like you’re all about you, avoid using we and I, especially in announcement type communications. And use you and your instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with the exclamation marks, if you make this one simple change, it will require you to do some heavy lifting to suddenly change the rest of the words in the sentence. But that’s a really valuable exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because suddenly you will be forced to cast what you’re saying in terms of the value to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not about your emotional state. I’m excited about this new feature. That’s not the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the point you’re trying to get across in your email is why they should be excited, than say that instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be happy to hear. Your opinion matters. You’re going to love this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, subtle change, but gives the impression that you’re all about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spotlight is on them. You really do, as I know you do, spend all of your waking moments and sleepless nights thinking about your customers, your users, your readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself as this specific person having the worst possible day. Mary from Topeka is in no mood for you little funny jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s had a really rough day. She was late to work. Spilled coffee on her favorite new shirt. Her boss reamed her out. And now she’s opened your funny little email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it funny? Or is it going to fall flat on her worst possible day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you don’t write or communicate out into a vacuum. You communicate out to human beings who are having good and bad days. And probably, arguably, more bad than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, it’s best to prepare for that eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>James Yancey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Yancey aka J Dilla deserves to be in the same sentence as John Coltrane and Miles Davis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;J Dilla joins Gilles Peterson’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gillespetersonworldwide.com/&quot;&gt;World Wide&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 to speak on several tracks from his solo album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_2_Detroit&quot;&gt;Welcome 2 Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, and other collaboration and production tidbits. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/92bpm/jay-dee-w-gilles-petersons&quot;&gt;30 minute interview here&lt;/a&gt; and read the transcription below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;welcome-to-detroit-259&quot;&gt;Welcome to Detroit 2:59&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the title Welcome 2 Detroit is welcoming you to Detroit! The realness, it’s about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compilation basically came about from a break beat album, Idea, that Peter from BBE had, which turned into giving Jay Dee 100 percent creative control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically he let me do whatever I wanted to do. So I wanted put people on there who was going to spit, lyrically, and represent each Detroit. Because I wouldn’t of been able to pull this album off if it came under a major [label].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they’re not going to just let you do a song or do an instrumental. You got to have this feature. And you Jay Dee, why don’t you have Erykah Badu or so so on your album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to go through all of that instead of just putting out beats on this joint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;think-twice-415&quot;&gt;Think Twice 4:15&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zUFkQNBqoU&quot;&gt;Think Twice song&lt;/a&gt;, the Donald Byrd &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7qcPCUn44E&quot;&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt;, basically to make a long story short it’s one of my favorite cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to replay it, sample it, anything. So that’s why I messed with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to also get it to sound like something I would find digging. You know sonically, for those that don’t know, that’s very hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying I did it. But it’s really hard. When I listen to a Roots album, it’s like they did a lot a work. They did a lot of work to get that sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you compare that to an Acid jazz group that does the same thing, plays the same instruments, records live and everything, sonically, it just doesn’t sound the same. It’s more of a raw sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bbe-600&quot;&gt;BBE 6:00&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Rg5e73sfY&quot;&gt;BBE&lt;/a&gt;, moving on, I wanted to do something if you hear it, you’ll hear trans europ express, that’s why I was trying to get across, but in my own way basically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of some terminator theme music. And that’s where the melodies come from the strings and the whole direction of that song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-expect-721&quot;&gt;What to Expect 7:21&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, what to expect is whatever I ain’t touched on. It’s what to expect you can say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything I’ve done, I’m not about to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s my word. Y’all going to see it. Bear witness. Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7vkD6ZT664&quot;&gt;Rico Suave Bossa Nova&lt;/a&gt;. You know just show people a little difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;runnin-910&quot;&gt;Runnin’ 9:10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out y’all, got a little story for you. I’m going to tell y’all about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwHuEDCM7xs&quot;&gt;Runnin’&lt;/a&gt;. You know Pharcyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a fight out of that song from members of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the 950 filter sounds better than the ASR-10. That was the argument. And that was the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean a fight. A fight. That’s one just one instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the others. I’ve done seen this cat get his arm broke. And cats with leopard skin boxers on, their pants coming down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m telling you, man, the making of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJAsMo-A_q0&quot;&gt;Pharcyde Labcabincalifornia album&lt;/a&gt; was hilarious. It was just all the way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me prepared for what was ahead in this rap game. Is Pharcyde still together? You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bootleggers-1125&quot;&gt;Bootleggers 11:25&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember coming to World Wide, almost 2 years ago, I was in the middle of doing a Slum Village joint. That whole album, that was an experience you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said we went platinum in the streets. Multi-platinum because everybody got bootlegged. Everybody. Different companies got bootlegged to the point when it finally came out, everyone already had it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all good. To speak on it, I really thank you. I thank the bootleggers because you actually helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that gave me, I guess you would say a little power. In this industry, it’s needed being an artist who wants to change things and wants to do something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t do it alone, basically. It took all of that bootlegging for the labels to look at it and say, “This is actually, people want this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get on it. I appreciate it. It’s cool with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-common-1346&quot;&gt;Working with Common 13:46&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with Common, I tell everybody, it’s like working with Slum, Frank-n-Dank, Phat Cat. That’s like, he’s a midwest cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s automatically, he’s connected with us. Damn near staying in the D [Detroit]. He’d been coming to Detroit for the longest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of knew what he wanted. He gave me an idea, a direction he wanted to go, basically, just let me do my thing after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you bring is what we’re going to do. From hooks to beats to whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common speaks on Dilla&lt;/em&gt; 14:25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay Dee is one of the best producers to ever touch it. Point blank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s been so innovative with his sound and so like progressive with it. Even though you know his feel, it’s like he can give anybody what they need really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s got a certain funk to it. A special thing about it. I don’t know. I can’t put my finger all the way on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically from the work he did with Tribe from him producing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN6PoMDI-s8&quot;&gt;Janet Jackson song&lt;/a&gt;, on and on it seems to go. He ghost produced that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people don’t know. If you listen, you can tell he ghost produced that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the work he did with Busta, even Pharcyde and Slum Village. People just feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say this from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulquarians&quot;&gt;Soulquarians&lt;/a&gt; perspective. People like QuestLove, D’Angelo, and James Poyser - they all sit and study Jay Dee. He’s like the genius behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was the one where they sit, and wonder how does he do this or that, and they start trying to play similar to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not like they don’t have their own thing. The point of the matter is they do look to him for inspiration, as do many producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is the boy is dope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ummah-and-q-tip-1725&quot;&gt;The Ummah and Q-Tip 17:25&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ummah consists of 4 cats. Raphael Saadiq, Jay Dee (myself), Ali and Q-Tip of Tribe Called Quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to speak on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN6PoMDI-s8&quot;&gt;Got ‘Til It’s Gone&lt;/a&gt; by Janet Jackson. Who really did the production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t sound like a Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis beat. That’s not to say any names, but it just doesn’t sound like it. I know they could of done it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is Q-Tip rapping on it? It sounds like a Tribe beat. We all had an input into that. Me, Tip, and Ali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, there is cats coming up producing, and have joints come up and your name is not on it. You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all good. It’s all good in the end. You just got to stay focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH2BTUACBVc&quot;&gt;Beats, Rhymes, and Life&lt;/a&gt; and from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Movement&quot;&gt;Love Movement&lt;/a&gt;, Q-Tip, from day one, we’ve been on the same page. Always. Creatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4195A8AC085B435B&quot;&gt;Q-Tip album&lt;/a&gt;, I Just used to send him joints. It was love like that. He used to get beat zip discs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never send that to anybody else, you know what I’m saying. But I trusted him like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dangelo-2021&quot;&gt;D’Angelo 20:21&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a D’Angelo story, going back working on the Slum album. The illest thing I can remember is going to the studio and seeing D’Angelo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was him and Ahmir Thompson, but this cat comes in, D’Angelo comes in first with a cigarette, just chilling, kicking it, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he gets behind this fender rows. You know I jammed with him before, but this was the first time we were recording. We were about to put something down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swear I have DATs at the crib of playing, just him and Amir. It seemed like it was all night. Different grooves too. Ok, we’ll use this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got to say he is, the thing he does with that keyboard, you can’t play like that. He’s got his own thing. He’s like Stevie Wonder with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s the Soulquarians crew. D’Angelo, myself, Ahmir, and James Poyser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We automatically clicked. The Aquarian thing. Come to find out, we’re all aquarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I mean Ahmir is in my head. I can say this, Ahmir, if I could just pull him out of my head, he would be the drum kit I would use on joints. Because it’s unlimited. It’s unlimited the things he can do with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D’Angelo would be the keyboard player. The song arranger in my head. It’s unlimited. Like if I have samples I want to play, he’ll do it, just like that he’ll play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s drums I want to loop in, Ahmir will come in, and put it right there. The EQ. Just like ‘em.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s definitely good to have them two brothers in my pocket. Whew, because that’s some serious business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to find talent like that. What I consider the best of the best right here. It’s like okay, what do we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to touch everything. I tried to it in this little compilation, I tried to touch a couple areas. But we’re going to really try to take it somewhere else. Really try to take it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And try a complete album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-of-music-2604&quot;&gt;Future of Music 26:04&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny how things work. I have to say I’m blessed to have the opportunity to work with such artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny how things come together. And people come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I think this music. This whole thing is about to do a 360. In a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the good music is coming back around. People are making, I wouldn’t say good music, people are making things they’re honestly proud of. That they feel. That’s truly them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank God first. People are starting to accept this Common single, which is somebody who never sold over 125,000 units before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, he’s got a Gold album and the single is doing well. It’s good to see that it’s turning around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the Roots go get a Grammy a couple years ago. It doesn’t have to be all watered down, non-original stuff you hear every day. It can be a little bit of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know myself and the people I work with, as far as Common to Busta, all these artists, De La Soul, we all have this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this goal is to we want to change things. Make a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;erykah-badu-2733&quot;&gt;Erykah Badu 27:33&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell y’all a story. Check me out. Here’s a nice juicy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama%27s_Gun&quot;&gt;Erykah Badu album&lt;/a&gt;. She’s at the crib. She makes this tea for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, for whatever reason, I have a headache. Crazy headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re chilling upstairs. I tell her, I’m going to chill out for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the beats are banging upstairs. She’s writing. I’m just going to take a breather. It’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She comes upstairs and fixes me some tea. You notice my voice change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She fixed me some tea, sat on the couch with me. The next thing you know I’m getting a massage from Erykah Badu. Mhm. On top of me. Straddled. While I’m on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, nothing happened. It was just nice to have Erykah on my lap. Immediately after that, we made the track &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VxI5k7ih2g&quot;&gt;Kiss Me on My Neck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;influences-2931&quot;&gt;Influences 29:31&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some influences &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk&quot;&gt;Kraftwerk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)&quot;&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown&quot;&gt;James Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McDuff&quot;&gt;Jack McDuff&lt;/a&gt;. These are all people, I grew up listening to in my household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classical music, I can’t even name anything. My mother listened to classical music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old doo-wop music. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platters&quot;&gt;Platters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Freshmen&quot;&gt;Four Freshman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead&quot;&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt;. Probably a Stereolab Omar. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Tek&quot;&gt;Hi-Tek&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Timbaland&quot;&gt;Timbaland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/madlib&quot;&gt;Madlib&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, check &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmgB84swpIE&quot;&gt;Feather, Going Through Changes&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know why I think of that. It’s on Discovery Records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually one of the joints I did use on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH2BTUACBVc&quot;&gt;Beats, Rhymes, and Life album&lt;/a&gt;. This song is a good song to listen to. So I definitely recommend that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you-james&quot;&gt;Thank you, James&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the whole interview. Dilla is a legend. His &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/news/55953-j-dilla-equipment-will-be-donated-to-smithsonian-museum/&quot;&gt;MPC is in the Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard Dilla listening to my brother’s old Pharcyde compact discs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwHuEDCM7xs&quot;&gt;Runnin’&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1DEBbbck6c&quot;&gt;Splatittorium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co3qMdkucM0&quot;&gt;Drop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy shit. That’s all I could say. The drums and the swings instantly put me in a better mood. And I had no clue who Dilla was back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zs2By9H6t8&quot;&gt;Common’s Like Water for Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. Q-Tips solo ablum, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4Z-PUOoHAg&amp;amp;list=PL91727DA77FDC828A&quot;&gt;Amplified&lt;/a&gt;. Slum Village on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jqKyfrsr5k&quot;&gt;Office Space Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goodness, this music was incredible. I started to figure out who he was. And when I did, I also learned he was sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real sick. Dilla was living with lupus. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/j-dilla-dead-at-thirty-two-20060213&quot;&gt;passed away&lt;/a&gt; February 10, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continues to inspire millions with his music. Earlier this month, on his birthday, I came across an interview from 2001 and it was a pleasure transcribing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found myself nodding in agreement multiple times while listening to Rachel. As someone who works in customer support, this felt like a much needed pep talk to me.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support-is-a-feature-321httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat3m20s&quot;&gt;Support is a Feature &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=3m20s&quot;&gt;3:21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our experience with Perch, the support that we offer for the product is possibly as important as the features of the thing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look on Twitter to what people are saying about us, a lot of the stuff we’re seeing is about the support. It’s about what people think about the help they’re getting. And we see some really nice tweets from people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So support can be an amazing marketing tool. Especially for people like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a product that is aimed for people that are using it for their business. They’re using it to provide services to their clients. So, it’s really valuable to them that we’re going to help them out. And they know they’re going to get help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support is really great marketing tool. People talk about good support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of help we’re giving people and the speed of our response is really important. Because we’re a commercial product in the CMS space. And there’s a ton of free content management systems out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes us different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the things that makes us different is that we help people. We really, really help people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-pay-for-support-432httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat4m32s&quot;&gt;People pay for support &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=4m32s&quot;&gt;4:32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think sometimes the fact that people get support is what makes them buy Perch the first time. They think this is important, and I’m a bit worried will I be able to do this, and they know they’re going to get help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe they’ll buy that first license. And we see that a lot. You get help. It’s worth it. It’s worth paying for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support is important. I say it’s actually been vital to the success of Perch. It’s been vital to allowing us to become a product business at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feature-requests-1520httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat15m20s&quot;&gt;Feature Requests &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=15m20s&quot;&gt;15:20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature requests come up in support a lot. A lot of our requests is people actually saying I want Perch to do this or that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s great in an awful lot of ways. The development and direction of Perch has been massively led by what the customer has asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first launched, we were essentially a content editor. We had no ability to add new pages. We didn’t have an API at the time. It was a very limited content editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t really see a need for it to add new content pages. We thought people would build a site and let people edit stuff. But then there was sort of an overwhelming demand from people wanting something a bit more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we built on it. And created all sorts of functionality. Perch is able to manage much bigger sites than we ever imagined Perch 1 would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you talk to people, you can kind of see the path and the road map. People often say, “What is the road map for Perch?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we say, “Well we kind of know what we’re going to be doing in the next month. But then we’re going to see what the feedback is to that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently launched a Members app, which is essentially for people to be able to login at the front end and downloading PDFs or accessing secure content. That was something we never thought was a Perch thing. But it became this up-top request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re always getting information from people. What do they want? What can we build? What can we do to make people happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while you’re doing that, you have to be really, really careful. Because you have to protect the core use case of your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to say yes to every request that comes in. Yes, we can do that. It’s just code, we’ll write that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing client work, that’s kind of ok, because you’re just building one thing. It’s fine to say, oh yeah, code that and there it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re adding stuff to your product, it’s a whole different ballgame. You could quite easily end up with a product that is bloated and unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in our case, it would of sort of become the thing we built Perch to get away from entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cant-please-everyone-1857httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat18m57s&quot;&gt;Can’t Please Everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=18m57s&quot;&gt;18:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However hard you try to meet the needs of people and however hard you try to give people what they want, there is always going to be someone accusing you of not listening because you haven’t already added their very specific feature request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a whole ton of stuff in, and some of it is incredibly specific. We can’t find a good way to make that a generic thing that could be useful to more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got to decide, not only how not to bloat the product and make it unusable, but also where is worth putting development time in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will benefit the majority? What will benefit the most people when we add it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not filling that request of that noisy person because you are listening. You’re listening to the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority is quite hard to listen to because they tend to be quiet. You don’t hear from people who are happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people are happy, it will just get in the way, they’re working on their projects. They might say on Twitter, “I just launched this with Perch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you don’t hear from them because they’re happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to think everyone is asking for this one thing, so we should develop it. And it’s actually a tiny percentage of the customers who want that one thing. And is that the best place to spend our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;differences-in-people-2521httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat25m21s&quot;&gt;Differences in People &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=25m21s&quot;&gt;25:21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a difficult customer is just a customer that has a different way of interacting or perhaps is using English as a second language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of that. Sometimes translated English can come across a bit rude or just difficult to understand. Web designers tend to have very good English because they need it to do their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how that actually comes across can be a bit strange. We’ve got a story, I don’t think this customer was using English as a second language, but she certainly was confused by what we said to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Drew was talking to this customer, and she was confused by some aspect of the software, and Drew referred to the mental model or how to sort of visualize something. Or how things worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this made her furious. Drew couldn’t understand why the customer was furious. I read the thread, and I didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the customer thought Drew was calling her a mental model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe she was a model. I don’t know, we don’t tend to call our customers names. But it was this baffling thread, and left you wondering why this was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that happens quite a lot. Sometimes a person comes in and we’re thinking this person is really angry at us, and what have we done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just translating from another language, and they come across as very short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-support-out-of-the-product-2827httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat28m27s&quot;&gt;Design Support out of the Product &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=28m27s&quot;&gt;28:27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some extent, you can design support out of your product. I’ve got an example here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the Perch login screen. When someone logs in to admin Perch, it does a check that Perch is registered against that domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can set up they’re staging and live domains for each license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our original messaging said, “Sorry your license key isn’t valid for this domain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the person would then come into support. So we changed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we changed it just to give them an instruction of what to do. So people knew what to do when they saw the message and we didn’t get any more support requests about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if a lot of people are contacting you about the same thing, there really ought to be something you can do to fix it. It’s tempting just to stick things in FAQ. But if you do that, you end up with a huge FAQ. And that isn’t useful to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can actually fix the issue in the product, then the support just goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-documentation-2925httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat29m25s&quot;&gt;Different Documentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=29m25s&quot;&gt;29:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people need help and they need it in different ways. We have a load of documentation and it has to serve everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to serve that person who can barely write HTML right through to the person who is an experienced PHP developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For someone who is new, text documentation isn’t the best thing for someone who is starting out with a content management system. So we put out a bunch of video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The videos are massively successful. A lot of support requests don’t come in anymore because people go and find the videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when people do say they’re having trouble getting started, we ask if they’ve watched the video. They say no, and they go watch the video, and they’re sorted and up-and-running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing a variety of help materials and in different formats is really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-a-good-customer-3712httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat37m12s&quot;&gt;Being a Good Customer &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=37m12s&quot;&gt;37:12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An awful lot of requests that come into the Perch system basically say, “Help. It’s not working.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we do about that? We ask them what is not working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. If several thousand people are using a product and the support forums aren’t full of angry people, it’s working for most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So obviously what you’re doing is slightly different. It doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might being doing something that is slightly unusual that we haven’t come up against yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really hard for anything to be completely bug free. You need to give some information. Things tend to not be just broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re heading into support for a product you’re using or whether you’re heading somewhere like StackOverflow to post some request for help with CSS or whatever, the more information you can give about the particular environment your code is running in, the easier someone can help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact in those free support forums like StackOverflow, kind of those quick wins, are the ones everyone wants to answer. If someone has given all the information, you can read down and say, yes I know what the answer is and answer it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s great you feel good, you’ve answered someone’s question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question where you know you’re going to have to tease out some information is not so fun to answer. You know it’s going to take you all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, once you can reproduce an issue, it’s well on its way from being solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the key really for any support. How can it be reproduced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s a CSS issue, how can I actually see it on my screen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s something in Perch, I’m going to need their template or the things that they’re using to get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-you-expect-3851httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat38m51s&quot;&gt;What Did You Expect? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=38m51s&quot;&gt;38:51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that is really important for us to know is what did you expect to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most bugs that people encounter aren’t actual bugs that throw an error. What they are is you thought that doing this would cause one effect and another effect happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when someone comes into support and says, “Well, it’s doing this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll say, “Well, yes, because that’s how we wrote it. That’s what it does.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we don’t know the important information that they thought it did something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we know what they expected to happen, we can kind of guide them to what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-support-4225httpsyoutubez1npuknudyat42m25s&quot;&gt;Good Support &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Z1NpuKnuDyA?t=42m25s&quot;&gt;42:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, good support gets you back to your project as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t want people to spend a lot of time hanging around in our support system. Not because we want rid of them. Not because they’re annoying to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because if they’re in there, they’re not working on their project. They’re not working on their business and doing what they want to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, we want to deal with people as quickly as possible and get them back to their projects, so they can have a good experience using Perch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s really what all support should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be about getting people back to work with the tools they need to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take a half-hour and listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46-XiMOoJE&quot;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Manoj_Bhargava&quot;&gt;Manoj Bhargava&lt;/a&gt;. Manoj is founder of 5-Hour Energy, a philanthropist, and full of wisdom. The story behind the product is fascinating and Manoj’s common sense will smack your right across the face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Ryan Singer (@rjs) for sharing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rjs/status/660153222984781825&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the talk months ago. Watch and listen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46-XiMOoJE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-ways-to-get-technology-105httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet1m5s&quot;&gt;Two ways to get technology &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=1m5s&quot;&gt;1:05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only two ways to get technology. To invent it. Or to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inventing has the same chance as a lottery ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we formed a company that looked for technology worldwide. I liked chemistry because I thought it was a really simple thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You mix a bunch of cheap stuff together and sell it for more. That’s basically chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we had submissions from thousands of PhDs across the world. And large companies started hiring us saying, “Can you find technology for us?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found out, of course, the large companies, all they have is committee meetings. They would actually never get anything done. So we dropped those contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this technology at a trade show. We went there and somebody introduced us to this company. And we had a meeting with them, and at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, I said, “I have 8 hours of meetings and I’m not making it. I’m not able to get through it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to them and said, “Didn’t you have some energy something. Can I try that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gave me this thing and I said, “Woah, this I can sell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-its-a-small-bottle-257httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet2m57s&quot;&gt;Why it’s a small bottle &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=2m57s&quot;&gt;2:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about 30 days. What I did was instead of making a large drink, I did a small one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, I thought why is someone tired and thirsty at the same time. That doesn’t make any sense. So why not make it small?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the other thing was from the retail level. Do I have a big bottle and compete against Coke and Pepsi for the cooler space? That sounded really dumb. So I said, “Ok, let’s not do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I make it small and I’m in the front and I’m by the counter, I’m competing against keychains and batteries. I can handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we made it small. The first one was 1 ounce, unfortunately, you couldn’t read it. So we made it 2 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-do-dumb-stuff-425httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet4m25s&quot;&gt;Don’t do dumb stuff &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=4m25s&quot;&gt;4:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no experience in consumer products. All we were armed with was common sense and hey, we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with the trunk slammers. The guys who throw stuff in the back of their car and go to store to store peddling stuff. We started there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we got into drug stores. Then we got into Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have 4 different items at every Walmart at checkout, which is the most difficult space in the world to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We became one of the largest consumer products in the world. We are the largest dietary supplement product in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, all of it was common sense stuff. I tell people, we weren’t that smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing we did was we just didn’t do dumb stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that really, pretty much, differentiated us from all corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even to this day, people say, “How many people do you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our offices, everything all together, we have 65 people. Not including our plant, which has 250, run as a separate company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say, “Wow, you must be really efficient?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say, “No, we’re not efficient at all to tell you the truth. We just don’t do useless stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I did was cut out everything that didn’t make money or didn’t improve the product or didn’t make the customer happy. It’s got to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And doing that, you get rid of hundreds and hundreds of potential things. We don’t do strategic initiatives. I can’t even spell that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jargon-639httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet6m39s&quot;&gt;Jargon &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=6m39s&quot;&gt;6:39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed out of jargon, partly because I’m not familiar with all the MBA stuff. There is so much jargon and I can’t spell most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think the people who use it also don’t understand it. But they have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you gotten a resume and every second line there is strategic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just did it differently. We said just use common sense and just go. And do it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an example, most of the meetings last about a minute or two. Because most of the time it’s like a decision of saying, “I’m on the roof, should I take the stairs or the fast way down?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really not a decision. And yet they’ll schedule a half-hour or hour meeting with 18 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we jump off the roof or take the stairs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, at least the people we have, would rather take the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did really simple stuff. And our whole job is to make the business really simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It usually flies in the face of all experts. Experts do not like simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-giving-away-90-of-his-money-831httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet8m31s&quot;&gt;On giving away 90% of his money? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=8m31s&quot;&gt;8:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two choices. I can wreck my son’s life or I can give it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, do really stupid stuff or do not do stupid stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided let’s go this way and not do dumb stuff. Today, we are the largest charity in India that nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other guys are nice, but they tend to do more announcements that work. We don’t have anything big or fancy to gauge how well we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing we look for is how many people that are underprivileged, did we significantly affect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you really don’t know, sitting behind a fancy desk in an air conditioned office, what they need out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One guy, one of these big shot billionaires sitting behind these desks, said, “How should we do this, so it’s sustainable?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a little annoyed. I said, “It’s not about you. It’s about them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a business, it’s about a customer. The same way you go out to a field and find out what do they need, and then do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-work-in-our-company-1721httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet17m15s&quot;&gt;How we work in our company &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=17m15s&quot;&gt;17:21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have MBA speak. If someone comes to me with an a project or something that needs to be done, the first question I’ll ask is, “Is this useful? How is it useful?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it’s not useful, it better be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it’s not useful or entertaining, there is only one other basket left. That’s useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To us, business is really not rocket science. It’s just do useful stuff. And avoid useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-an-expert-1838httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet18m38s&quot;&gt;What’s an expert? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=18m38s&quot;&gt;18:38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert is someone who knows everything that was. He’s really good at what was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you ask him about what will be, he’ll say, “No, no that cannot be done. Because I’m an expert of what was.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I need you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if I want to do what was, I don’t have a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prime-directive-1935httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet19m35s&quot;&gt;Prime Directive &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=19m35s&quot;&gt;19:35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have what’s called the prime directive. If any of you watch Star Trek, there is a prime directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime directive in our company is no aggravation. Nobody gets to give us aggravation. Whether it’s customers, vendors, employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aggravate, you got to go. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s really business. Usually it’s the one percent, some customer that has one percent of your business and he’s driving you nuts. And he’s taking up 80 percent of your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is that business? Aggravation is the largest cost in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it’s really simple, we live here at the work. If an employee is such that they’re going to cause havoc or aggravate, they need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time, one of our senior guys yelled at a receptionist. I called him in and said, “Look. You can’t yell at her. You can fire her. If it’s that bad, they need to go. But we live here, don’t mess up this place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that aggravation, if you avoid it, not only do you have fun, it’s a great place to work and nobody quits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t get people to quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-takers-2121httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet21m21s&quot;&gt;Risk takers &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=21m21s&quot;&gt;21:21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody asked me should we have risk takers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs. Risk takers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said no, no, no. Entrepreneurs are not risk takers. If someone in my company wants to take risks, I say, “Go work somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our job as entrepreneurs is to minimize risks. To manage risk. To give the risk to somebody else. Not take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to take risks, go to Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-entrepreneurs-really-need-2324httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet23m24s&quot;&gt;What entrepreneurs really need &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=23m24s&quot;&gt;23:24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All jargon does is bury common sense. All entrepreneurs need is two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All they need is two things. Common sense. And a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked who should we learn this stuff from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer was your mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she has probably done more management than your MBA professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she’s got a budget. All these kids running around. Hard to manage. All of these things have to be done seven days a week. Now that’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s hard work. That’s learning on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mbas-2505httpsyoutubex46-ximoojet25m5s&quot;&gt;MBAs &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=25m5s&quot;&gt;25:05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think MBA is totally useless. I’m not saying they don’t teach anything of value. I think they teach this much that is useful. They teach this much that is useless. And they teach this much that is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, average is on the useless side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you come out of school and you actually think you know something. Really? And that’s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you really don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never hire people out of fancy schools for that reason. My first question usually to an MBA is, “How are you going to get over it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple thing. If you’re going to learn plumbing, go learn from a plumber that has actually seen a pipe. That has fixed a leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just written about pipes, lectured on pipes, and researched pipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not for theoretical plumbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me either, Manoj.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Saya Hillman</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sayahillman&quot;&gt;Saya Hillman&lt;/a&gt;. All I can say is I’m a fan. This is one of the first episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kadavy&quot;&gt;David Kadavy’s&lt;/a&gt; fantastic new podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kadavy.net/blog/archive/podcast/&quot;&gt;Love Your Work&lt;/a&gt;. Saya shares how she started her &lt;a href=&quot;https://macncheeseproductions.com/&quot;&gt;own company&lt;/a&gt; after being fired, how she defines her own success, and how to find your own superpowers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few excerpts are below and you can listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/saya-hillman/&quot;&gt;hour long conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-mac--cheese-productions-start-659&quot;&gt;How did Mac &amp;amp; Cheese Productions start? [6:59]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for very selfish reasons, started my company Mac &amp;amp; Cheese Productions. When I got fired, I realized I never wanted a boss again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also realized that there are really painful, awkward ways of meeting people. Networking events, single events. I’m sure everybody has been to one of those events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like I should of just stayed home in my yoga pants eating Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s watching Friends reruns. It was a complete waste of time. Complete waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t handle going to any more of those events. When I graduated, I went to school in Boston and came back to Chicago, and I kind of had to start all over again building my network and community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I think a lot of us as adults go through, and it was a lot tougher than I thought it was going to be and I thought that it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So selfishly, I thought this is ridiculous. My life shouldn’t be work, gym, watch TV. There has to be more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my company, I wasn’t really around people all the time. I was working from home and it can definitely get lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started throwing events that I would want to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-events-did-you-start-with-901&quot;&gt;What kind of events did you start with? [9:01]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one that started wasn’t a business venture. I just enjoy bringing people together in uncomfortable situations and making them feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For friends, and I wasn’t charging anything, because it was fun to do, I started throwing these dinner parties called Minglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People would come over to my space. I think that environment is really important in creating a space where you’re allowing people to be vulnerable and let their guard down. And that’s why it was really important that we have it in a home environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People would come over on a Friday or Saturday night, and the caveat was you had to come over by yourself. Because I think when you go to places with people you know, you stand in the corner and talk to them the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you go somewhere, where no one knows you, it’s a blank slate. That can be very freeing, it’s really nice to be whoever you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idea-potluck-1202&quot;&gt;Idea Potluck [12:02]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big believer of stealing and tweaking. There are so many wonderful things out there already. The whole don’t reinvent the wheel cliche, I think is very applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things out there that you may like except for X, Y, and Z. A couple of things that you would change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous events out there that have this kind of short format. Where a few select people, 6 or 8 people, are given 5 or 10 minutes to do whatever they want. That has existed for years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I loved the idea of getting a bunch of creative people together in a room and giving them a wide open blank slate to do whatever they wanted. But having the parameter of only getting 6 minutes to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the similar events out there require you to use slides and technology. And not everybody is into that. I think that it can take away from some presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as an audience member, I don’t necessarily want to sit and listen to 8 power points in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our role is just 6 minutes. You can do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-friends-over-30-2105&quot;&gt;Making Friends Over 30 [21:05]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to find your tribe is really important. After college, that tribe, you have to actively go and look for it. As opposed to when you were at summer camp, when you were in college, there was a  huge friend dump on your dorm floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are all these people who are the same age as you and have similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html&quot;&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; that I always reference and love, called “Why is it so hard to make friends over 30?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the sociologists quoted in that reference the conditions you need to create authentic relationships, like you had in college and summer camp. You need three conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need proximity. Repeated unplanned interaction. And an environment that encourages you to let your guard down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I keep in mind. Every time I create events, that is what I’m going for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media-is-highlights-2242&quot;&gt;Social Media is Highlights [22:42]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a highlight reel. That is what Facebook really is. It’s I got a job, I’m going to Hawaii, I just got married, I just got engaged, look at my babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t post look at my stretch marks. I got fired. I didn’t get the promotion I wanted. I haven’t been on a date. I haven’t had sex in 6 months. Whatever it is, people usually don’t post that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like my events encourage people to be a voice and share their imperfections. It’s your imperfections that make you interesting and make you who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as soon as you say, I have debt. I hate my mom. I have infertility problems. Other people in the room are going to get the courage to say, “me too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how a community is built. I think that is the foundation for feeling fulfilled and living a life of yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-name-the-company-mac--cheese-productions-3150&quot;&gt;Why name the company Mac &amp;amp; Cheese Productions? [31:50]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a list of all the things, that when I think of them, they elicit really positive, comfy, warm, fuzzy, feelings inside of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like Big Wheels and Cabbage Patch kids. Peanut Butter and Jelly, Mac &amp;amp; Cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for about 20 seconds, I was Peanut Butter and Jelly Productions. And then I was like, no, I think I like Mac &amp;amp; Cheese better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I universally love comfort food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nike-the-bejesus-out-of-life-3451&quot;&gt;Nike the bejesus out of life [34:51]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main hurdles people [Cheese-its] they seem to face is - I really want to make a change in my life, socially, professionally, romantically, spiritually, whatever it is - but there are so many options out there. So I’m paralyzed by the choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to help people [Cheese-its] understand having choice makes us infinitely richer than so many other people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that we have an education. The fact we have a support system. The fact we have these resources at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see choice as a good thing and not a negative thing. And not be paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see way too many people say, “Oh, I would start my business, but I don’t have a website. I don’t have a logo. It’s not the perfect time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always talk about the perfect time unicorn. He is never coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never going to be the perfect time to do something. Just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nike the bejesus out of life. And it will work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-you-should-be-required-to-take-an-improv-class-3935&quot;&gt;Why you should be required to take an improv class? [39:35]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best decisions I made as an adult is to take an improv class. I think improv is one of the most awful, horrible, scary, best, worse things that you can do for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as working on that fear of I’m going to fail. I’m going to embarrass myself. Getting rid of judging yourself. Getting rid of judging other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have no plans to be the next Tina Fey or be on Saturday Night Live, I think everybody should be required to take an improv class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes you a better person. Better boss. Better employee. Better spouse. Better significant other. Better friend. Better parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-make-your-bed-6001&quot;&gt;Do you make your bed? [60:01]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I think that’s such a waste of time. Who cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not, I do not make my bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I make my bed when people are coming over like if my husband’s mother is coming over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say, if you work from home, in order to be productive, you have to wake up a certain time of the day and you have to put pants on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is one of the perks for me of being self-employed and working from home. I rarely put pants on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole point of that is make your bed. Don’t make your bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put your pants on. Don’t put your pants on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-advice-do-you-want-to-leave-6318&quot;&gt;What advice do you want to leave? [63:18]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power you can find in realizing you’re not alone. Not having shame about X, Y, and Z. And also voicing whatever it is your issues are or your concerns are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would highly encourage people to be vulnerable. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en&quot;&gt;Brené Brown’s vulnerability talk&lt;/a&gt;, her TedEx talk is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be vulnerable. Take an improv class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not know what your superpowers are, and you do have superpowers, you just may not realize them, a suggestion I would make would be to email 5 people in your life from different sectors. Friends. Family. Co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ask them what they think your superpowers are. It’s such an eye-opening, awesome, experience to have that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s your superpower?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>William Ury</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a conversation between William Ury and Simon Sinek. The two discuss Ury’s new book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamury.com/books/getting-to-yes-with-yourself/&quot;&gt;Getting to Yes with Yourself&lt;/a&gt;, and other negotiation tips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a dense back-and-forth, so you might find yourself rewinding the video a bit like I did. Sinek adds a lot with his questions (listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en&quot;&gt;his TED talk&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t before) and shares his own experiences too. Check out the excerpt below and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqV6pjX_dP0&quot;&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-stops-us-from-getting-to-yes-204httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t2m4s&quot;&gt;What stops us from getting to yes? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=2m4s&quot;&gt;2:04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years it began to sort of dawn on me, as I really started to look at the question of what stops us, what’s the real obstacle of us getting to yes or what we truly want in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that the biggest obstacle of us getting what we want in life or getting to yes is not what we think it is. It’s not that difficult person. It’s not that difficult organization. They can be difficult for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most difficult person is the person we look at in the mirror every morning. It’s right here. It’s us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s in our own very human, very understandable tendency to react in ways that don’t serve our true interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-opposite-of-blame-348httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t3m48s&quot;&gt;The opposite of blame &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=3m48s&quot;&gt;3:48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite of blame is taking responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, when we blame, we might think that’s powerful because you’re blaming the other person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you’re actually subtly disempowering yourself. Because you’re saying it’s the other person’s fault. I don’t have any stake in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you take responsibility, which doesn’t necessarily mean blaming yourself, it just means taking a constructive, positive approach towards it. You empower yourself and you’re more likely to get what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-taking-responsibility-mean-707httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t7m07s&quot;&gt;What does taking responsibility mean? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=7m07s&quot;&gt;7:07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking responsibility doesn’t mean blaming yourself. It means accepting that you’re part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That it’s yours. You’re a co-creator of that situation. Even if, in your mind, you might be 1% of the problem, you’re still a co-creator of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that gives you the power to change it. Because once you take responsibility, you can change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re blaming, you can’t change. You’re just dependent on the other side. In fact, you’re their prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;batna-738httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t7m38s&quot;&gt;BATNA &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=7m38s&quot;&gt;7:38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In negotiation, the secret to power is often what we call your BATNA. You’re best alternative to a negotiated agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, before you go into a negotiation, what am I going to do to advance my interests, if for some reason I’m not able to reach an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can’t reach an agreement with this particular organization about a job, maybe I’ve got another job opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if I can’t reach an agreement with one customer, maybe I’ve got another customer. In other words, knowing you have that alternative, it gives you a sense of confidence and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is I’ve taught that for 30 years, people often don’t do it. Why don’t they do it? They’re just focused on the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t think about their BATNA. I’ve come to realize, in fact, maybe there is a psychological antecedent. This all goes back to, again, yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is an inner-BATNA. The commitment to yourself that you’re going to take care of your own needs. Which then makes you less psychologically dependent on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then oddly enough, like if you’re in a relationship, if you’re less dependent psychologically or emotionally on your partner, you’re likely to have a better relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you care. But you don’t care that much that you’re going to get highly triggered every time you get together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-the-universe-unfriendly-or-friendly-1030httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t10m30s&quot;&gt;Is the universe unfriendly or friendly? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=10m30s&quot;&gt;10:30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein once said, “The most important decision that every human being has to make is to decide whether or not the universe is friendly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Einstein say that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can choose. If you choose that it’s friendly, you’re likely to interact with people as if they’re possible partners in a cooperative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think it’s unfriendly, and you see everyone as your adversary, and the whole world as hostile, then you’re going to behave that way and everyone is going to be very hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He though the future of the human race depended on us answering that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;go-to-the-balcony-1539httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t15m39s&quot;&gt;Go to the balcony &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=15m39s&quot;&gt;15:39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the ability to start to invoke your inner scientist and observe what is going on. It’s almost like you see what is going on in the negotiation on a stage, and part of your mind goes to a mental and emotional balcony overlooking that stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you can keep your eyes on the prize. You can see what’s going on. A little bit of detachment to observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can then ask yourself the question, “What’s my why here? What do I really want out of the situation? What’s my intention?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I’m about to go into a difficult negotiation or even a phone call, I like to take a moment or a few minutes of just quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to yourself. Watch yourself. Go to the balcony. Set your intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that helps. If you get caught or carried away with the thing, take a break. Take a time out. And realize it doesn’t all have to be done at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a moment after the interaction to ask yourself, “What did I learn here? What would I do differently next time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slow-or-fast-1740httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t17m40s&quot;&gt;Slow or Fast &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=17m40s&quot;&gt;17:40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motto in negotiation is if you want to go fast, you have to go slow. Because human minds don’t change in a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can slow down to where that human mind is, then you have a chance to bring them much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go really fast, there is a resistance and they shut down, and then it’s going to take a lot longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-starts-with-you-3110httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t31m10s&quot;&gt;It starts with you &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=31m10s&quot;&gt;31:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-acceptance. Maybe the greatest gift you can give yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have this voice. This inner critic. That is criticizing and doubting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists says we have almost 60,000 thoughts a day or maybe up to that. And the great majority of them are negative. If you actually sat down and counted all the negative thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to accept yourself. If you can accept yourself, you can accept others. If you respect yourself, you can respect others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-kind-of-leaders-3735httpsyoutubedqv6pjxdp0t37m35s&quot;&gt;Best kind of leaders &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dqV6pjX_dP0?t=37m35s&quot;&gt;37:35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes back to the leaders. It’s not the charismatic leader that is necessarily the best one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the one that is willing to be accountable. The one that does the hard work. They’re not so flashy. They have humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re able to learn. And that opens them up. It’s infectious to the rest of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right on, Mr. Ury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joulee&quot;&gt;Julie Zhuo&lt;/a&gt; chats with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uberbryn&quot;&gt;Bryn Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brian_lovin&quot;&gt;Brian Lovin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spec.fm/show/design-details&quot;&gt;Design Details&lt;/a&gt; podcast. Julie shares her path from being Facebook’s first intern to leading design on a product that is used by billions of people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a transcribed excerpt, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spec.fm/show/design-details/13301&quot;&gt;whole interview&lt;/a&gt; is full of useful advice. Be sure to check out some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joulee&quot;&gt;Julie’s writing&lt;/a&gt; too :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-being-a-manager-about&quot;&gt;What is being a manager about?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, what I really enjoy is working with designers and really helping designers become better designers. I think that’s the part that I really love to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, being a manager is really about knowing the team and knowing what the team needs. You sort of look at the team, and say “these are the problems that our team needs to solve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do we have the right people? And are the people working on the best things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that let them really leverage the things that they are good at, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And are they paired with people that they love to work with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they feel like they’re learning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what else does the team need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the kinds of questions I get really interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You talk about those things like what is a good design process for the team? What are the ways in which this group of people can produce better work or be more efficient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or love what they’re doing a little bit more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, management in many ways is also a design problem. It’s just you’re designing more of the people side of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-has-changed-as-facebook-has-grown&quot;&gt;What has changed as Facebook has grown?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a product perspective, when we were a college site, it was much easier to change stuff around. Because everybody would be like, “awesome, you launched this new feature. I love it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would rearranged things, and they’d be like “great, love what you’re doing!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, we were still doing that. Of course, we could just push a button and people would get a re-design or a new Facebook. At then at some point, we realized we could no longer really do that and have people be comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so gradual. We were growing, there were more and more people. But at one point, I think we were still operating as we did a year or two ago, and suddenly we were evolving and launching these designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And people we giving us all this feedback like, “wow, why did you guys change that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Give me the old thing back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-roll-out-new-changes&quot;&gt;How to roll out new changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s been a learning for us, is how do we roll out new changes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we do change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’re still a company that really wants to move fast and continue to build new things. And we don’t want to just get stuck. Right? That would be the death of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s totally important for us, culturally, to be able to continue to improve our product. But we also need to balance it now with the fact that when you have over a billion people using your service, and again they’re not all college students who are looking for the next thing and open to change, they are people for who change is going into your living room and changing your furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like even if it’s a better configuration, you still have to get used to it. So we have to talk about it more. We have to tell people why we think it’s good. Why they’ll benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to hold ourselves to that bar a little more too when we build things. It can’t just be for changes sake. It has to be worth the cost of what the change will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one thing, the other thing on the product side is to continue to make sure our product doesn’t get infinitely complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it’s always much easier to add things than it is to remove things or rearrange things, as we talked about rearranging things is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you always keep adding new things at some point, you realize this is really, really complex. And we need to figure out how to simplify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that to me is all about the evolution of a product. Figuring out how we continue to do that at the scale that we are at now is still one of the biggest challenges that our product teams always talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-to-think&quot;&gt;Writing to think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first year I said I am just going to write one thing a week. It doesn’t have to be any good. It can be about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal isn’t trying to build an audience. I’m just going to write whatever is on my mind and get into this habit of doing it, and hope that it will get easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first couple times, I would sit in front of the computer blank screen and I’d have no idea what to write about. Two hours would pass, I would open a couple more browser tabs and read other things to try to get inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was awful. It would take me forever to figure out what I wanted to write about. But as time passed, it did get easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my goal for myself was just to do it, to publish something once a week, it did get easier and easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did that for a year, and then the second year I was actually really enjoying this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned was that I when I was sitting down to write, it helped me think. It helped me, with all of these hazy things, to kind of distill them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for myself, it helped me get to a crisper articulation. The process of writing was a learning thing or self-discovery thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;value&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would consider Facebook a very product-centric company. I don’t mean product in terms of PMs (product managers), I mean it terms of what actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product and what does it do for people. And does it solve their problems? And does it actually have impact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re very focused on that aspect. That is how we think about design as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the frameworks we use to talk about design as Facebook is, you’ll see this heart and it’s got these three pieces, the first piece is value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we build should have value meaning it solves a problem, it does something that is worth it enough for people that they would use it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You know you have something valuable when a lot of people repeatedly come back to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a feature or whatever is. That’s sort of the most critical piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t have something that is valuable, almost the other details don’t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a lot of what we try to build are things that we hope will impact a large amount of people. We’re not really looking to build niche experiments for a small subset of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that the things that we do are going to be applicable to a large number of people. That’s the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think about design, we’re always thinking about what’s the problem? What do people want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do they behave? How do they think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is this going to solve that? Does it have the right dynamics in order to do the thing that we want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ease-of-use&quot;&gt;Ease of use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the next piece after that is ease of use. Frankly, anything that is valuable, well then everyone will use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then in this landscape there’s always competition for value, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of other things will come up that will offer the same value in terms of functionality. I think then you start to compete on which one is easier to use. Which one is more accessible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ease of use includes everything from performance, which is a huge part of what people perceive as is this easy to use, to the interaction design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your hierarchy of the app? Do you have the most common things up front or do yo have good content that explains it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or are people just having to navigate this clunky thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the next thing. But again, in this market, competition is very fierce. Lots of apps can offer the same value and similar ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;craft&quot;&gt;Craft&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at last you start to distinguish good products based on craft. I think craft is the idea that the people who built it just really cared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They cared about you, your experience, they cared about end to end, the holistic aspects of your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think everyone kind of understands craft at a high level. There is an idea that this thing, furniture you’re sitting on or whatever it is, food that you’re eating, is made with love and care. And people who sweated the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you have to have all of these things to have a product that feels really well designed. And feels like something people really love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are all the elements that we care about, but we really do want to make sure that we don’t sweat the details, if you haven’t even solved the value or the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t actually built something that is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-secret&quot;&gt;What’s the secret?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the secret process? What’s the handbook that will suddenly help us make amazing things in a consistent manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t think one exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the nature of creativity. Were that to exist it would do well at repeatable things, which I think are generally much more incremental. And they’re not the crazy new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012&quot;&gt;Creativity Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which I still think is one of the best books about all of this, the creative process. It sort of really resonated when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Catmull&quot;&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt; where he said the only thing you can expect is change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t be scared of that. You can’t think that it’s a bad thing. When things break down, and you need to refine your process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s just part of what it means to try and be creative, and to come up with things that continue to push the bar a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the same formulas or the same tried-and-true things people are working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that was one the best thing I’ve ever read in terms of putting a voice or a framework of how to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me relieved that there wasn’t some secret formula that none of us were discovering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;failure-or-success&quot;&gt;Failure or Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make something valuable, it’s not just will people see it and use it. But will they go back and use it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat usage. I think that is one of the clearest ways to know you’ve made something valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;facebook-profile-redesign-that-was-worse&quot;&gt;Facebook profile redesign that was worse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a great lesson and learning for us. We started off, brainstorming lots of different design directions. It was very easy for us to get excited about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, “oh my god, we would want this!” You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big photos. Super expressive. We thought that now that we had all these huge Apple monitors that this would be great. All of our friends are great photographers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we actually tried it, we all loved it. Then we launched it, and then we realized all the things that we were tracking were down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just like one metric is down, it was not just like revenue is down when you shipped it. No matter how you measured, whatever metric you could of thought of to measure whether this thing was valuable or not, was worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new design was worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent hours, we didn’t understand. It must be logging, something is broken. We spent all this time trying to understand why it was. It wasn’t going to be like “oh, it’s not as good because all these numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make peace with it, we had to really understand what was going on. What the hell is going on with this redesign?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lots of research, and uncovering and uncovering, testing pieces, and trying to get to the heart of the problem, I think what we realized is not everyone is like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has big monitors. Not everyone has amazing PCs or MacBook Pros. When you actually ran it on a shitty computer, 11 inch screen, it was a worse experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You couldn’t see the full story. You couldn’t see the photo and the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough people in the world are still using mice instead of track pads. The scrolling was much harder. The likes and everything was centered, and it was harder for them to reach over. Everything kind of moved over more. So imagine you’re trying to click these buttons on the story, and then you had to go over to your scroll wheel and press down on the little scroll arrow to advance the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these things took longer. It was a worse experience, so people were like I’m just not doing to use this as much. Because it’s harder now to read stories and do all of the things we wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a really interesting lesson for us because I think we were designing for ourselves and we weren’t as clear or aware of the fact that the audience for Facebook is so global, in so many different markets, and a lot of people weren’t all like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would listen to this again and again, thanks Julie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kevin Maney</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a lecture &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kmaney&quot;&gt;Kevin Maney&lt;/a&gt; delivered at the Kenan-Flager Business School at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2009. Kevin talks through the trade offs we constantly make between fidelity and convenience. If you want more on this topic, check out his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Trade-Off-Some-Things-Catch-Others/dp/0385525958/?tag=mmr-support-20&quot;&gt;Trade-Off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots to digest here and some marvelous examples that will make you think. It’s a two part video, check out excerpts and links below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKy0YihRZY&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpjyxtFuPQ&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-trade-off-0014httpsyoutubeveky0yihrzy&quot;&gt;What is Trade off? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VeKy0YihRZY&quot;&gt;00:14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve done with this book is essentially try to create a lens for looking at the way things work. It’s kind of like the tipping point or innovators dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a way to look broadly, and maybe explain the way some things work and maybe the world works. It’s not an absolute. It’s not an answer machine. It’s not like Zoltan where you make a request and it pops out the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is a framework that has resonated with a lot of people. And it actually helps you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea here - to make you think about certain things you’re involved in or the way things work or the marketplace works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fidelity-0134httpsyoutubeveky0yihrzyt1m34s&quot;&gt;Fidelity &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VeKy0YihRZY?t=1m34s&quot;&gt;01:34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple things fidelity is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity is not this idea of you and your spouse sticking together for 90 years or whatever. And it’s not about music or high fidelity music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think of it, use this word with a bit of a broader meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fidelity is the total experience of something.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So part of that is quality, the quality of a product or service. It’s also something more, the way a product makes you feel or giving you some sense of identity about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was doing research for this book, I got turned on to a 1930’s philosopher named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin&quot;&gt;Walter Benjamin&lt;/a&gt;, who added to me an interesting aspect to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was writing at the dawn of time when machines could actually reproduce things. He started thinking, if a machine could reproduce a copy of a Picasso painting, exactly as the original Picasso painting, why is the Picasso worth more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote about this concept called aura. The original Picasso has an aura. It was touched by him, painted by him, it actually gives the owner a certain sense of who they are because they own it and display it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is that sense of aura that makes it valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That figures into this idea of fidelity. The total experience, the aura, the identity is part of this concept of super high fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Convenient &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VeKy0YihRZY?t=3m33s&quot;&gt;3:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other word here is convenient. Again, a couple things we’re not talking about with convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not your local 7-Eleven. And not necessarily the TV dinners you can make easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Convenience is just this whole idea of how easy it is to get what you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of that is ease of use. Part of that is ubiquity, how available is something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of times, but not all the time, cost is a factor. Because is something is really low cost, it’s naturally easier for someone to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;putting-it-together-0413httpsyoutubeveky0yihrzyt4m13s&quot;&gt;Putting it together &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VeKy0YihRZY?t=4m13s&quot;&gt;04:13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about these two concepts broadly. Fidelity being the total experience of something and convenience being how easy it is to get or do that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you put it together, we’re constantly going through these trade-offs in our life between the quality of the experience and the ease of getting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re often going to do something that is high fidelity even though it’s inconvenient to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re often willing to do something that is convenient, even though the fidelity is not that great like shopping at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you plot these two things on an axis like this, kind of representing the trade you’re willing to make - one easy way to explain this is the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/31427?token=fPlgjJqjLw6WHjeBeqTm-MRVPQdaOD5-iNRb4NMyIgg-199EVyrHNGevvo1-HTCLD615BF0C916rUF2qhdpG5MA&quot; alt=&quot;trade-off-chart.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two parts of the music industry that are doing really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One part is the super high end concerts that cost a lot of money. Think of a U2 concert, it’s the whole experience of the band being there and seeing them live. The crowd around you and the ability to tell your friends later that you went to this U2 concert, it was all part of your identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a super high fidelity experience and they charge $200 a ticket, and they sell out. Even though it’s tremendously inconvenient, going there, parking, fighting the crowds, and the high cost of the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other end of the music industry that is doing really well is the iPod and iTunes downloads [2009]. That’s very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to do, it’s pretty inexpensive, you get to carry 10,000 songs in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fidelity or the sound fidelity of an mp3 is like 10 times worse than a compact disc. You’re willing to give up or trade off that fidelity for that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fidelity-belly-0701httpsyoutubeveky0yihrzyt7m13s&quot;&gt;Fidelity Belly &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VeKy0YihRZY?t=7m13s&quot;&gt;07:01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in music, what is the one thing that’s not doing great? Compact discs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compact discs tend to fall into this zone where they’re neither a tremendous fidelity experience or tremendously convenient, so you’re not willing to make the trade for one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It falls in this so-so zone where it gets a lot of consumer apathy. That’s why compact disc sales have been plummeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this other part, which is the equivalent of having U2 play in your living room. Which I guess if your the president you can do, but it’s probably not a great business model for U2. And probably not a convenient model for most of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XUl57hwM2zo/T1I2l6lxKyI/AAAAAAAAAUc/a3trqKpQIMw/s1600/Fidelity+Belly+(Cropped)&quot;&gt;model looks like this&lt;/a&gt;, and there is this spot in the middle, where products are neither enough fidelity or enough convenience to really get people excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call this area the &lt;em&gt;Fidelity Belly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is one other aspect of the chart, which is actually quite important. I put these two arrows at either end because I realize that technology constantly allows the borders of this whole model to change or move outward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the borders are moving out, the borders of that belly are constantly expanding also, which tends to mean if you have a product or service that stays static or sits in one place as the market keeps expanding, you’re eventually going to fall into that Fidelity Belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compact disc is a perfect example. When it first came out it was the most convenient way to have music for a long time. The compact disc didn’t change, so as the borders kept moving out, it became more and more stuck in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, and something I worked at for 27 years, is newspapers. It was the most convenient way to get news for the longest time. It landed at your door step, this big package of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it didn’t change for all these years, and more convenient ways came along to do it and papers ended up getting stuck in this zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;netflix-example-1031httpsyoutubeveky0yihrzyt10m31s&quot;&gt;Netflix Example &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VeKy0YihRZY?t=10m31s&quot;&gt;10:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix. I went to a conference in 2005. It was called Web 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 2005, and Reed Hastings was on stage and got asked why Netflix hadn’t started delivering movies on the Internet. Netflix is doing that now in a pretty aggressive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, they weren’t. The questioner was saying wouldn’t delivering movies over the Internet be a more convenient experience for your users. You don’t have to go to your mailbox or anything, it’s just there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hastings said, I constantly keep in my head this trade-off my customers are willing to make between the quality of the experience and the convenience of getting it. That is how I make decisions about what kind of products and services we offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the mass market of people who like to watch movies, trying to get them to download movies on the Internet is actually an inconvenient experience for them right now [2005]. It’s too difficult, there is all this DRM involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of my customers, going to get the DVD out of the mailbox, is a more convenient experience. And I’m not going to make that change yet. [Again, 2005]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;washington-north-carolina-1537httpsyoutubeveky0yihrzyt15m37s&quot;&gt;Washington, North Carolina &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VeKy0YihRZY?t=15m37s&quot;&gt;15:37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an email from a guy named Daniel Stevens in Washington, North Carolina. And Daniel runs an employment office in Washington for people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel said he read my columns, and it made me think about what we were doing here and why were not having much success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, to most employers in town, if we’re representing people with disabilities, we’re not offering them high fidelity employees or their ideal employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we probably can’t compete with other companies on the fidelity spectrum. And at the same time, we’re not particularly more convenient than anyone else. So in this model, we’re kind of in this Fidelity Belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we decided to try to be the most convenient employment agency in town. We let everybody know, the papers and the people who ran restaurants, if your dishwasher quits in the middle of dinner or on a Saturday evening, if you call us, we’ll have someone there in 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be the most convenient employment agency in town. He said it worked. It started to increase the number of placements they had. They had a lot more success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me realize that this can be applied to almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;love-vs-needed-0446httpsyoutubenxpjyxtfupqt4m46s&quot;&gt;Love vs. Needed &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NxpjyxtFuPQ?t=4m46s&quot;&gt;04:46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted Leonsis is the owner of the Washington Capitals. He was an old friend, and one of the people responsible for the fantastic growth of AOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this model to Ted, and he added something interesting to the conversation. For his entire business career, the model he kept in his mind was the same thing, but he used different words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For him, fidelity meant loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And convenience meant needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He always believed that any business he was in had to be either loved or needed. And it was very difficult to be both, and if you weren’t enough of either one, you were in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he bought the Washington Capitals, certainly nobody needed the Washington Capitals. For years since they were a rotten team, nobody loved the Washington Nationals either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were having trouble selling tickets, so they were stuck down here in the Fidelity Belly. He realized that he was never going to make the Capitals needed, what he had to do was make them loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he invested in the team, not only to have a winning team, but a team that people could enjoy. And the past couple years, they’ve set attendance records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tesla-and-electric-cars-0641httpsyoutubenxpjyxtfupqt6m41s&quot;&gt;Tesla and Electric Cars &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NxpjyxtFuPQ?t=6m41s&quot;&gt;06:41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric cars have been tried so many times over the years, but they’ve never been successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big reason is every electric car that came out was kind of econobox version of cars. They were not cars that would make many people excited about buying them. They weren’t going to be loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they certainly weren’t going to be convenient. Because you would drive around the city for 30 or 40 miles, and then you’d have to go plug it in to charge it overnight. Compared to gas cars where you pull into a gas station and refill it in 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every electric car that came out was neither convenient or fidelity, neither loved or needed. As a new product it would come out and sit in the Fidelity Belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insight that Tesla people had about electric cars was that you had to break out of that one way or the other. So why not break out of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of making an electric sports car, make the best sports car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give people a reason to love and want this particular product. So they built the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster&quot;&gt;Tesla Roadster&lt;/a&gt;, it’s going to cost $100,000. But it’s a kick-ass sports car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aura and identity factor of it is so high. The waiting list for it is like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Larry Page, and George Clooney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starbucks-1241httpsyoutubenxpjyxtfupqt6m41s&quot;&gt;Starbucks &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NxpjyxtFuPQ?t=6m41s&quot;&gt;12:41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic example is you go to business school, you draw an X and Y axis, and the upper right is where you have to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question mark here is, in this model, wouldn’t it be best to be super fidelity and super convenient at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to illustrate that question through Starbucks. If you think about these two concepts, fidelity and convenience, they actually have a very natural pull against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fidelity kind of product, and it’s all about exclusivity, high-end, and you start to try to make it ubiquitous and drive the price down, it’s pulling it down too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have something that is really high convenience, it’s about low cost and availability and ubiquity, and you try to start to add features and price, you’re pulling at that convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks started out as a super-high fidelity brand of coffee. Howard Schultz bought this little coffee shop in Seattle and he was passionate about the quality aspect of the coffee. That’s what he talked about and wrote about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To him, Starbucks was all about trying to create this great experience in the stores. It was some place that you felt like you were at home, that was special to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wanted the brand to represent something to you. So that you felt is was part of your identity if you walked around with these cups with a little green label on it. The coffee has to be special and good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all about a sense of identity. He created that magically, wonderfully. Starbucks took off, it became part of the public’s consciousness. It was the kind of coffee you aspire to, it cost 5 bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Schultz ended his tenure, and Starbucks took on with new management, it was all about driving toward convenience. They thought they could keep this fidelity and try to create something that was absolutely ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Store after store, across the street from each other. The joke in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/article/new-starbucks-opens-in-rest-room-of-existing-starb-560&quot;&gt;The Onion that I loved was new Starbucks opens in restroom of old Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got to a point where the wheels started to come off. Same store’s sales started to drop off, stock prices fell, and it put pressure on management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bunch of things had happened. The more they tried to drive out to the mass market, the quality of what they were offering declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They couldn’t train baristas fast enough, so the product wasn’t made right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They switched to automated coffee machines to try to keep up with the demands. But the automated machines, most people felt didn’t make the coffee as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks had completely blown up this idea of creating an experience, of a place to go to, by opening little kiosks in grocery stores and selling instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started to dilute that brand until Starbucks became not so cool anymore. If you really wanted to be cool, you went to Caribou Coffee or some little independent shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up calling this space the &lt;em&gt;Fidelity Mirage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a place you can’t get to. If you try to drive for that spot of super fidelity and super convenience, the tensions between the two pull at each other until the whole thing falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Schultz came back and made all these announcements about getting back to fidelity. He shut down half the shops for a day in the US to retrain all the baristas. He started closing shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the interesting question for Starbucks. On the aura and coolness side of things, once you lose it, can you get it back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-use-this-1801httpsyoutubenxpjyxtfupqt18m1s&quot;&gt;How can you use this? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NxpjyxtFuPQ?t=18m1s&quot;&gt;18:01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a way to think about things. It’s a lens. One way you can use this is to understand where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re managing a product or coming out with a product, or have a company idea, understanding what is is you’re offering and where it sits on this continuum for the market you’re trying to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps you understand what you need to invest in and what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What trade-off are your customers going to make?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for making me think, Kevin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Torrey Podmajersky</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This a talk delivered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/torreybird&quot;&gt;Torrey Podmajersky&lt;/a&gt; at the 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;http://conf.writethedocs.org/&quot;&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt; conference. Torrey is a UI writer for Microsoft. She has worked on Xbox and other projects that are used by millions of people. Torrey sprinkles in dynamite examples about how to keep people moving when using your product. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40&quot;&gt;full video here&lt;/a&gt; and excerpts below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ui-text-0056httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t56s&quot;&gt;What is UI Text? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=56s&quot;&gt;00:56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to tell you about these two cars. My husband’s car is this 1972 Triumph GT6. It doesn’t run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you can get it started and there is this fountain of gasoline. And it’s a super hazardous experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this Chevy Spark. It’s a 2013. And we have very different things we read about these cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our customers, whoever reads our documentation, read for very different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband reads to study. He needs to know everything that there is to know about this car. He needs documents with all the terminology. All the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He needs it to have great depth of accuracy and precision. He also needs to investigate. Why is this happening? He needs the academic approach. He needs the clinical pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also needs verification. He needs to go to the forums. He reads up on why is this happening? Or will this window sill work for this model even though I can’t get it anymore and it’s not the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wants promises and examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we fast-forward to the other side, I want to do. I want to use my car to drive to a thing and get the thing done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I want is indicators. I don’t ever want to think about what I’m reading for my car. Or I want it done for me. Notifications, things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s on this far side, where our UI text lives. We want to just indicate. We want it to be invisible. We want it to be intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-only-three-reasons-to-use-words-in-your-ui-0324httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t3m24s&quot;&gt;The Only Three Reasons to Use Words in Your UI &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=3m24s&quot;&gt;03:24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep ‘em playing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ease the way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establish brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing. I said that I worked on Xbox. Playing in Xbox is about gaming. It’s about being entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to talk about playing as experiencing the mental flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we are playing when we are working. Right? I’m not only a technical writer. I am a fiction writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am definitely playing. I’m in the state of mental flow and things are just happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you’re playing, you want just the words that make sense to you. You don’t want to be interrupted by any of the extra things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s say it’s 2008. You’re on a PC. Maybe you’re gaming? Maybe you’re playing? Maybe you’re writing your great novel that is about to come out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=5m&quot;&gt;blue screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at this, we’ve taken them from whatever they’re doing, and maybe they’ve hated what they are doing, whether or not in this state of flow, whether or not they’re playing, sometimes bad things happen and we have to break the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is this going to help them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ease-the-way-0623httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t6m23s&quot;&gt;Ease the Way &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=6m23s&quot;&gt;06:23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very important. Sometimes doing it for them or keeping them going isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are unintended bumps along their path. So we tell them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can search for the error online: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (storachi.sys)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not just giving the error code, which some people will know they can lookup online. We’re telling them you could do this thing if it would make sense to you and be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing this screen got an awful lot of press for is establishing brand. We recognize that even in our error messages, and sometimes especially in our error messages, we’re reminding our customers who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the old blue screen of death it was “here we are, we’re super technical. We know all this stuff. And we’re going to be super wordy at you.” That’s not a great brand promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not like, “boy, I hope someone will come be super wordy at me today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ui-is-all-around-you-0802httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t8m2s&quot;&gt;UI is all around you &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=8m2s&quot;&gt;08:02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bathrooms have a lot of written UI. When you’re in the bathroom, maybe it’s not mental flow you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/30147?token=l49dy4BQsWdxCORhP27zIaWU-zUfYXgGH1HR9bhkLw-NOt7Aq7dns60kK1Tqxeui0rZWZcVwUK5ZTHAazqwAKe0&quot; alt=&quot;keep-em-playing-example.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do want people to be able to keep doing what they intend. And that’s what it’s all about, respecting customer intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another example from Nordstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/30148?token=oNnhRgxo47FJ5YRaq-KiVTBoh_MiCJ45pPpleRHMKfA3G4eMiyC8hiuw-__ZSgj38iRFF91d17H0cCPACE_bC4k&quot; alt=&quot;nordstrom-example.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are very brand aware. Bathrooms in Portland, not very brand aware. It’s our water will burn you and we know our lock is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nordstrom very brand aware. This is actually their app down message when their service is down for overnight maintenance. When you go to their app, you’ll get this message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re doing a really interesting thing here with their voice. Anecdotally, I’ve learned from one of their UX writers, that they are going for unexpectedly witty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how hard that is. I would like to be unexpectedly witty in my day-to-day life. But in error messages? That’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they ease the way. They know that can’t keep them playing right now. But they can say, “you can come back at this time, and it will work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;every-ui-is-a-conversation-1110httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t11m10s&quot;&gt;Every UI is a Conversation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=11m10s&quot;&gt;11:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how a conversation works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say what needs to be said. You don’t just keep going and going and talking like you’re four years old. And you say it out loud. You don’t make it be implied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also take one thought per turn. You convey an idea, and then you wait for them to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also end the conversation gracefully, so that both parties know it ends. And you’re kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-each-word-earn-its-place-1350httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t13m50s&quot;&gt;Make each word earn its place &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=13m50s&quot;&gt;13:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only use words to fill a necessary purpose, taking up only the space required so that people will understand, be informed, and/or act as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I can say that better. Nobody needs these extra thats. I can say only using the space required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really need to say be informed, and/or act. Right? If they understand, they will act the way they want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really that whole thing sucked. I can say it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make each word earn its place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-the-right-mood-1608httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t16m08s&quot;&gt;Set the right mood &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=16m08s&quot;&gt;16:08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use words that contribute the desired emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can say that better to. Use words that set the mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the right mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screen I worked on a lot for Xbox One. When you’re signing into a Xbox One for the very first time, that has a kinect sensor attached, it will look at you and your living room space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already has enough information to put a flag over your head. And say is this you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section says, &lt;em&gt;“sign in when Kinect sees you, before you pick up a controller or remote control - without even turning on a light or putting down your sandwich.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not only legal text, but regulatory text. Privacy policy text. It’s telling you that Kinect can see you in the dark and recognize you and your motions. You can control it before you turn on a light or put down your sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does this feel better than say a bulleted list of Kinect can see you in the dark, Kinect can recognize you in the dark?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy is really legal, but with a posse. They love it. They say they don’t want to be creepy and think it’s not fun. We just want them to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-that-the-words-are-easy-to-read-1820httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t18m20s&quot;&gt;Check that the words are easy to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=18m20s&quot;&gt;18:20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check that the words scan without effort. Scanning is important. We know that right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is even more important is that they are easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the interior of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It’s supercool inside and it’s enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a photo taken inside the museum of flight in Seattle. You can totally go there and check it out. It’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was there, I took a picture of this door. It has this placard on it. So this placard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visually ensure the mode select handle is fully inside the red placard for armed and green placard for disarmed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/30160?token=63H1QLV3nYfiUsnTFM2QQMPmLD3rhsska3fMgTzHFa6ETPfxICdImnsjXdFuOoduYzqYmm5IWhEk-3YwrChjCrM&quot; alt=&quot;placard-example.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure this is what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check before opening. Handle in red: armed. Handle in green: disarmed. If you’re red/green colorblind, ask for help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-what-gives-the-best-results-2028httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t20m28s&quot;&gt;Use what gives the best results &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=20m28s&quot;&gt;20:28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one should be good right? Use correct grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw your tomatoes now. How about common grammar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually screw that. Use what gives you the best result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test it. Just like the Magnavox control? If you’re not testing it, you’re not going to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screen that has several pictures of what we tested when you sign into your Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It asks you, &lt;em&gt;“who do you want to sign in as?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a true thing that happened. I got an email two works before ship, this is an excerpt of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who wrote this? Should be whom! Can’t end with “as”!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a tester from a team I worked a lot with in the past. I just didn’t know this one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I respect the team and that connection is super important. This person wasn’t crazy, they just care a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I said in short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Thank you for caring about the text. “Whom” and “as” aren’t my job. I use language to guide our customers where they want to go.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screen? The hell was tested out of this. We knew it worked. We knew it got people going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to point out that there’s an enormous amount of re-working that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ve shipped a single word that hasn’t been reconsidered and rewritten and redone and examined. Some of it didn’t get tested, and we learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-do-the-words-go-2358httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t23m38s&quot;&gt;Where do the words go? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=23m38s&quot;&gt;23:58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to decide that together with our designer. We need to write as the design emerges. They need to design as the message changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know sometimes the problem is with the people I work with, how do I get it right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is theme that has emerged. We need a seat at the table. We have the writer and the designer. And this is for a big company, and I know a smaller company might not have all these people, but they have all these things that need to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is planning, funding, researching, coding, marketing. Together you’re shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can let them know that you’re there to help. And not just tell them, but you need to demonstrate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can show up. And you say internal terminology. We’re calling this CSV? What does that stand for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currency stored value. Pretty sure that means money. Can we call it money? Oh, we can. Okay, good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to help them focus on the customer. It’s not what’s the use case. It’s why would a customer use this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the mood. If you’re meeting with engineers and they’re embarrassed because a thing went out and it broke, and people hated it, and they’re defensive and feeling bad, they’re going to write offensive error messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re going to go, “well, it’s totally your fault. If you were smarter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, help them adjust their language internally and it will help them when the product ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how do you get to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you build their trust. You ask questions like, “hey, what’s the value to the customer and what’s the value to the business?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show them you understand the purpose of what you’re shipping and keep yourself informed about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research your own answers. If you don’t know the right words for it, say “I need to look into that.” And then follow up. Speed is of the essence. Responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to advocate for great outcomes for your customer and your business and the engineering team. The what’s in it for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to let them see our awesome self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;words-are-work-2713httpsyoutubeamrfkcmyc40t27m13s&quot;&gt;Words are Work &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AMRfkcmyc40?t=27m13s&quot;&gt;27:13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve handed out these buttons that say words are work. And several people are like, “but I have fun with it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a little disconnect there. And I say that’s very true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words are work for us. They’re awesome work. It’s fun to work. It’s creative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s work where we get that sense of flow. It’s work worth paying for. It’s work worth getting right. It’s work worth caring about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big responsibility. It’s also work that is difficult. It’s full of ambiguity. I mean have you seen the English language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s often contentious. I think for a second everyone thinks they’re a writer. It’s work that is often underfunded. Understaffed. Underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now words are work for our customers too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to learn. They want to know. They want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to keep playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more words we put in their way, the less playing they get to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So keep ‘em playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right on, Torrey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Merlin Mann</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies&quot;&gt;Merlin Mann&lt;/a&gt; shares some wisdom in this talk delivered at the E4E Developer Conference in 2014. It’s inspiring, funny, honest, damn good advice on how to get better at whatever you do. Below are excerpts, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR6e-mnvhv8&quot;&gt;entire talk&lt;/a&gt; is worth a watch and listen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-is-elusive-320httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t3m20s&quot;&gt;Better is elusive: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=3m20s&quot;&gt;3:20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it very hard to get better at things. I find it very difficult to do. I think a lot of people struggle with it for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you get better at doing a thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get better at doing a thing, how do you know you’re getting better at doing the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When do you know it’s time to go to another thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you avoid becoming the world’s greatest master of something nobody really cares about anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stages-of-getting-better-2422httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t24m22s&quot;&gt;5 Stages of Getting Better: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=24m22s&quot;&gt;24:22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition&quot;&gt;Dreyfus model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Novice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced beginner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proficient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start following rules, and eventually move to intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am super interested in the person who isn’t even a novice yet. What’s the step before novice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even know, what I don’t know, about what I don’t know about.  Before you misunderstand Ruby, you have to know about Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s such a cliche, but I think about it all the time. Maslow’s hammer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I suppose it’s tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it was a nail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Abraham Maslow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don’t understand what problem you’re solving, when you don’t understand the problem domain, you will try just the craziest stuff because it’s the one tool you could use without breaking your finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that a funny thing about expertise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;novice-2920httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t29m20s&quot;&gt;Novice: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=29m20s&quot;&gt;29:20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a novice? A novice is the new person on the job. They could conceivably follow the rules, but they’re screwing up so often that they’re not really following them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, once you’ve crossed novice, you can boil water. You can follow the directions to boil water and not set yourself on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t there something mindful about being a novice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any one here take yoga?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried yoga and boy did I realize the whole time I was totally a novice. There’s not a single part of yoga that was not novice for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bit was excruciating. I knew the entire time, I sucked hard at yoga. There was never a time where I thought I should get a mat and a bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire time I was hurting, and I was feeling stupid, and I was realizing there was no lower I could go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew about yoga, but I was not good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that part of the good thing about being a novice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a little bit of beginner’s mind. You’re open to new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advanced-beginner-3035httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t30m35s&quot;&gt;Advanced Beginner: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=30m35s&quot;&gt;30:35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advanced beginner is in the unique situation of having virtually no idea how little they know about something, but has every reason to believe they might be an unrecognized genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beware of the advanced beginner. How do you know if you’re getting better at something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we stall at the advanced beginner stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every level of expertise there’s a built-in blind spot. There’s something about it that’s difficult to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re at step zero, and don’t know nothing, you don’t even know what you know nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re a novice, you don’t know enough about the experience of doing what you’re being taught, so you have to follow the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you become an advanced beginner, you have no idea what little you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-expert-3600httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t36m&quot;&gt;The Expert: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=36m&quot;&gt;36:00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is somebody that has had to deal with different problems, in different problem domains, in different circumstances, with different teams, and different resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they still find some way to make it better than worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, just because you have not failed colossally, does not mean you’re not an expert. It just means you don’t have that much experience yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying we should go out and try to fail. But there’s so much to learn from somebody who has a hard time telling you why they think that’s the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite example is the old butcher. If you go into this place, and order three-quarters of a pound of roast beef, a very old shaky man will cut it and package it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about using one of those newfangled scales?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy shrugs and puts it on the scale. Three-quarters of a pound on the nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had this experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the kind of things I’m talking about. You know a tailor who can guess your size when you walk in. You know people who can tell what’s wrong with your car because how it sounded when you drove up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’ve known the butcher. The old butcher. Who knows how much is three-quarters of a pound, but can’t tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the life hack? What the trick? What’s the most important thing you need to know to decide that’s three-quarters of a pound of beef?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says you know the trick, the trick is to be a butcher for 40 years. That’s the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I love the expert. Even the expert has blind spots that they can’t tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;panic-3900httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t39m&quot;&gt;Panic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=39m&quot;&gt;39:00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the more you dig in on the thing you think you really understand, the more you’re shutting yourself off from the stuff in the world that you could be getting better at or that you should be getting better at next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should you be getting better at? And how do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panic! I’m not talking be scared or being anxious. I’m talking about panicking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panicking is when you wake up and go “oh my god, it’s too late.” Panicking is waking up and realizing all the skills I’ve got on my resume are not the things that are on those job boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it kind of interesting how that happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;humility-4325httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t43m25s&quot;&gt;Humility: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=43m25s&quot;&gt;43:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humility is when you go, “you know what? Maybe I’m not the greatest at everything because partly I don’t know what everything is yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was super into Ozzie Osborne. When they were on tour before his tragic death, not only was he one of the most shredding guitar players ever, but the story goes that Randy Rhoads would ahead of time pre-arrange classical guitar lessons in any town that he could along the way of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could pretty much guess that he could probably teach those guys something about guitar. But that wasn’t his attitude. His attitude was not, “I’m freaking Randy Rhoads!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His attitude was I want to get better at guitar every day if I can. What a huge difference. What a huge amount of humility. And it didn’t make him any less. It made him greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curiosity-4436httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t44m36s&quot;&gt;Curiosity: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=44m36s&quot;&gt;44:36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a single way in the world to tell you guys to how to be more curious or what to be curious about. Except to say, I think you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you would surprise yourself. You will surprise yourself when you become curious about more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have one piece of advice during this entire thing. This is really just an excuse to say, my god, why can’t we all be more curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I meet people at parties, or meet with them, or meet people on the street. People always want to network. Swap cards. And let’s LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically it all comes down to trying to figure out how much money you make. That’s what people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that I will ask my friends on a catch-up call, what I will ask the person who’s driving me here from the airport, what I will always ask the person is the same question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, what are you really excited about right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really general. But what makes people really awesome at what they do is curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about people who are curious about stuff for it’s own sake. I’m talking about the encyclopedia browsers of the world. The people who just want to know more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advanced-tricycling-4925httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t49m25s&quot;&gt;Advanced Tricycling: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=49m25s&quot;&gt;49:25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got our kid a three-wheel scooter years ago. The beauty part of a three-wheel scooter is you kind of can’t hurt yourself that bad on this thing. You get the pads. You get the helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s got one, two, three wheels. You can do crazy stuff. You can start off with your foot on the brake and just start rolling. Terrible skills that do not contribute to good two-wheel scooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scooter is now too small for my daughter, but she still wants to use it. It’s ridiculous. She looks like a dog in the circus. It’s become like a child-size novelty scooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she kept doing it. She even eventually said, “Hey, I’d like a big girl scooter.” So, we got her one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is we got her the big girl scooter, she got on it, it didn’t have three wheels, so it fell over. Not so interested in the green scooter anymore. Let’s go back to the little kids scooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We said, “Honey, please just give it a try.” Again, she’s almost getting back pain from trying to reach over to us this [the small scooter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is what she understands. When she was on the two-wheel version, that felt like the broken one. Because she couldn’t be good or fast anymore. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to her, that reads as failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a little kid, and I was first trying to ride a two-wheeler, I begged my parents to fix the god damn training wheels on my stupid bike. Because it was wobbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they said, “Honey, it’s supposed to wobble. Because that’s how you learn to ride a two-wheeler.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the training wheels on a two-wheeler were flush against the ground, they wouldn’t be training wheels. You’d have an old person trike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t have that awful, horribly, buddhist like wobble, you wouldn’t have learned how to ride on two wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where my kid was with this. She really didn’t want to get up. I said, “Honey, please just try it. Don’t worry, this is a closed course, you’ve got a helmet on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No interest. It just goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s getting farcical. My daughter, who is a giant and continues to grow, goes back to the three wheel scooter. We even bribed her. We said, “Honey, for your birthday we’re going to get you a big girl bike.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can pretty much guess how that went. We’re back to the scooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was ready to give up. I don’t want to shame my kid. I feel like I’m pushing her all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel like there’s something. Look at me. I want to be helpful. I want to explain how there’s a way to ride something on two wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you explain how to ride something that has two wheels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to give her lots of sage, zen advice about centers of gravity and chakras and shit. Like what am I going to say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get on it, and go you go fast enough, so you don’t have to fall down anymore. Invoice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s just not super fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, out of nowhere, I think she got a little bit curious. And she said, “We’ll give that a try.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She put on the helmet, she got out, and she started falling down. A lot. She fell down a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know where this story is going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t. I honestly thought she was just going to get brain damage and continue to ride this tiny, ridiculous, three-wheeled scooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cause I’m a nice dad. And I don’t want to be a dick about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the part that drives me completely bananas and I wish it could make sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She finally decided to give it a spin. First, in the garage a little bit. Then, going out on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was not having fun. And then something kind of ridiculous happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth time we took the big girl scooter out, she suddenly had no problem riding on two wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I felt like a dummy. Because I’d been sitting around for all that time trying to make her feel good about scooting around on her little three-wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I worry about advanced tricycling and the people who help us with that. Because sometimes, don’t you kind of feel like if I could just get the world’s most advanced, tricked out, power user training wheels, I could really fly with this thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s how I felt a lot. If I waited long enough, maybe my daughter would get super smart and get a crescent wrench and hack her wheels, so she was able to never have to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then an improbable thing happened last week. Now she’s trying with the training wheels on a real bike. I don’t even know who this child is anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My role in this? Getting out of the way and not giving advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thesis is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;what you’ll need to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;in order to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;what you’ll need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can tell you how to ride a bike. You’re just going to have to figure out that bikes are cool, you fall down a lot for awhile, and then you get to ride wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t have a pamphlet for that. That’s going to make that fun when you’re falling on your ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’ve got to get out of the way. But you still need that curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-more-thing-5452httpsyoutubezr6e-mnvhv8t54m52s&quot;&gt;One more thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zR6e-mnvhv8?t=54m52s&quot;&gt;54:52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to repot yourself. Somebody is going to repot you. Days will come along and something stupid is going to happen. Someone will die, a building will blow up, insurance didn’t work out. Stuff is going to change. And it’s going to get dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re going to have to repot yourself. It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when. And it’s a question of how ok it’s going to be when you land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;what you’ll need to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;in order to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;what you’ll need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It pays to stay curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even especially in the things you don’t know you’re curious about yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you, Merlin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jessica Lawrence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jessica Lawrence shares a story about leadership. From high school to the Girl Scouts of the USA to NY Tech Meetup, Jessica connects the dots about what is needed to be a leader. I was directed to this video by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffvincent&quot;&gt;Jeff Vincent&lt;/a&gt;. Check out his newsletter and subscribe &lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/UpDZz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And take 10 minutes to listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://poptech.org/popcasts/jessica_lawrence_on_leading&quot;&gt;Jessica’s story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doing-what-you-think-is-right&quot;&gt;Doing What You Think is Right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when I was in high school, it was a good thing to be featured in the school newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was sitting in class one afternoon during my senior year, when I came to realize there are times when clearly it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I belonged to a club called Peer Advisory. As members, we served as advisors and organized activities for middle school students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good group overall. But some of the members, who also happened to be the most popular kids in school, had started drinking and partying on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were not in my eyes living up to the club’s mission of being role models. So after learning this, I decided the most appropriate next step for me to take was to bring this up for discussion at one of the our club meetings, where I proposed we also sign a pledge agreeing not to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, berating your fellow teenagers for their behavior and for the fact that they weren’t being really good role models, didn’t go over so well. And they weren’t big fans for the pledge idea either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then I’m sitting in class a few days later, when the school newspaper is delivered. And I open it up and see my name in the news brief section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not celebrating something wonderful I have done. It was one line. And all is said was, “Hey, Jess Lawrence you suck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out a few members of Peer Advisory were also editors of the newspaper. And they had slipped that one line in after the principal had already signed off on the final draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final act in utter high school mortification that day, the principal then made the editor in-chief apologize to me, publicly, over the school’s address system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond this momentary embarrassment, I didn’t really care what the popular kids thought, I didn’t really care what they said about me in the paper, and I wasn’t too worried about breaking social rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I cared about was doing what I thought was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-rules-arent-created-equal&quot;&gt;All Rules aren’t Created Equal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s not already clear, I’m someone who likes rules. I’m careful. I tend to like order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the person who wandered around at college picking up all of the beer cans wondering where all the adults were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a person who doesn’t cut in line, who stays to the right on the sidewalk, and who always carries band-aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even for me, all rules aren’t created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teenage social rules could be trumped by this higher order rule of doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for those of us who are overcome with these visions of what’s wrong and how it could be made right, we often find ourselves in positions of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because at least at first, we can’t stand that gap between what is and what could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space that educator &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/travis-reed/standing-in-the-tragic-gap_b_1836239.html&quot;&gt;Parker Palmer calls the tragic gap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our early efforts about leadership are all about action. We plow ahead trying to escape that uncomfortable gap as fast as possible, trying to get to that place where things have been made right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my bull in a china shop method of trying to close that gap in high school had backfired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had a lot to learn about leadership and change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust&quot;&gt;Trust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And starting my career in a 100-year-old organization would turn out to be the perfect classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out as a fundraising associate at a Girl Scout counsel in Southern California. And I quickly learned though Girl Scouts have an amazing mission and do great stuff for girls, the organization was struggling with bureaucracy and hierarchy. And a lot of rules that did more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, it had developed an unhealthy culture. A culture that really diminished human potential instead of elevating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I worked in this environment for five year. At first sort of accepting that this is how work was. But slowly it started feeling worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I started thinking that this is not how work is supposed to be. Luckily, I was appointed CEO when I was 28 years old. And then I got to be in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized I should start making some changes. So my first attempt at change was to implement a flexible work program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided employees at a certain level and above could decide to work from home one day a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But right when I was about to start this program, one of my employees pulled me aside. She was one of the lowest paid people in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said, “Jessica why is it the highest paid people get to save money on gas and commuting costs on day a week, when people like me, who need that savings the most, don’t get to participate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you trust us less?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was speechless. I had never thought about trust in that context. This idea that your trustworthiness increased with your pay grade had been standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there I was about to follow in that tradition. I had tried gently pushing back against the rules. But it wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realized we needed to throw out the whole rulebook and start with something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;escape-the-uncomfortable-gap&quot;&gt;Escape the Uncomfortable Gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we made bold, rapid changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We became the first non-profit in the country to implement a results-only work environment. Where employees could work from where ever they wanted, whenever they wanted, as long as their work got done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We re-centered our organization around trust. And we worked hard to change the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And things got better. Employees were more engaged. They were happier to come to work. They were more creative and took more risks. Their well-being improved and our business performance improved as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t perfect, but we were on this up, up, up trajectory. Until it stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the people who were enthusiastic about change, were not so enthusiastic when it came time to actually start changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were moving too fast and the amount of change we were asking them to make became too scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that although I had started out with all the right intentions for implementing this change for the benefit of others, I became a bit too focused on my own desire to escape that uncomfortable gap. And get to that place where things had been made right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I had let that space, which I had usually left open for others, close just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space&quot;&gt;Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I left Girl Scouts, moved to New York and started my current position at New York Tech Meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I had expected the technology sector to be filled with incredibly enlightened people. Who not only were building innovating products, who were truly building innovative workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought they would be the ones who would be driving all the types of change I had tried to implement at Girl Scouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought they would be writing better rules of business and adopting more human practices of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while some are, a significant portion of this whole new generation of leaders are not advocating for the type of change I expected. And the type of change I think we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still seem to be embracing this relentless win-at-all-costs attitude. A mentality that emphasizes constant action. But as I had learned, being able to pause is essential for creating the space needed in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space to truly see and hear others. Space for difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space for agency and potential to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space to learn as I did from the people working alongside you asking you tough questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could go back to re-visit my 17-year-old self, I would stand next to her and give her hand a squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would tell her to slow down a little. I would tell her to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just to the supposed experts, but to all of those around her. And to herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would tell her to have courage and patience to stay in that gap. And I would tell her to not lose her boldness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because having something that you are willing to take action on is essential. Even if, you eventually realize that sometimes the best thing to do is pause and listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reminding us of that, Jessica.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Samuel Hulick</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SamuelHulick&quot;&gt;Samuel Hulick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mijustin&quot;&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://productpeople.tv/&quot;&gt;Product People TV&lt;/a&gt;. Samuel shares how he built &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useronboard.com/&quot;&gt;User Onboarding&lt;/a&gt; and what he’s learned along the way. Lots of useful examples of how to treat customers like human beings. Check out the full &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.productpeople.tv/70&quot;&gt;conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##How Did You Start User Onboarding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uibreakfast&quot;&gt;Jane Portman&lt;/a&gt; has an analogy that I use all the time, which is “it’s like having your suitcase packed with no handle on it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just can’t use it to get anywhere. And as soon as you put that handle on it, all of a sudden it becomes so much more useful. I feel like I had a full suitcase with no handle for a very long time and then eventually realized onboarding was that handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advice-on-getting-started-and-becoming-an-expert&quot;&gt;Advice on Getting Started and Becoming an Expert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost like the idea of picking something you’re not very good at. And then documenting all the questions that you have as you go through it, where these are all questions that other people will be having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just take six months and do some research to get to be C-Level good at it. “C” like grade, not “C” like executive. And just say, “hey I spent six months researching this thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell people, “if you don’t want to spend six months, you can spend $40 or whatever for me to give it to you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-people-do-with-your-product&quot;&gt;What Can People Do with Your Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about people. But it’s also not just about what your product does, it’s about what your product lets people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can they do with your product? That’s the important thing. Not just what does your product itself do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s easy for us to get caught up in thinking of the products we create as almost finished work. Like a musical composition. We sat down and created this thing, and look at how beautiful it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of it more as we’re creating musical instruments, which let other people create the compositions they want even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And looking at what is the end result for them. Not just what is the end result of what we created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t buy products. People buy better versions of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-onboarding-is-about&quot;&gt;What Onboarding is About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people mistake that onboarding is just getting people setup with the product or getting people better at using the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What onboarding should be about is helping the people get better at whatever the product helps them do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So getting better at TaxSlayer is not something anyone wakes up aspiring to do. But getting better at getting their taxes filed is something they’re very motivated to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So onboarding in TaxSlayer should not be about explaining what all these different parts of the interface do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboarding is not getting people from point A to point B in your product. It’s getting people from point A to point B in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So however you can reliably get people incrementally making progress, in TaxSlayer’s case getting taxes filed trajectory, is a lot more interesting in getting people to make progress in understanding how to use TaxSlayer’s interface trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just explaining how to the interface works doesn’t get people very far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-people-feel-successful&quot;&gt;Make People Feel Successful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about getting people engaged. Somebody is like, “alright, I’m sick of being a product manager screw up. I’m signing up for Basecamp today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like today was there day. They had probably been thinking about signing up for Basecamp for weeks, if not months. And today for whatever reason they’re like I’m going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How weird would it be if Basecamp we’re to be like, “let’s just talk about how to use Basecamp for the next five minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not really going to do anything. You’re just going to do a lot of reading. And then hopefully you’re going to remember every thing you need to know when you dive into the product. At then, the information will never be available again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a total momentum killer. So I really like the idea of people are fired up, they’re motivated, they’ve made it. At that moment, the moment they signed up, their attention will probably never be where it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you really get them engaged and scoring quick wins as quickly as possible, to get them to be successful as early as possible within the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-5-minutes-of-your-product&quot;&gt;The First 5 Minutes of Your Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of research I did when I started looking at onboarding was on video game design. It’s been around a lot longer. Game design theory is a little more evolved. A lot of overlaps with first level design and tutorial design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And looking at when video games, like a Nintendo game, would come with like a 130-page manual. You would never read that. I was just go in there and be confused. And have a miserable time and never play this game again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to read 130 pages about a video game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So video games are becoming a lot smarter in making the manual interactive. They’d have a tutorial that was front-loaded. But even then it was like when you need to jump press A and when you need to do this press B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t really fun. You were still just trying to memorize things instead of actually getting in and doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, looking at blending the tutorial into the game where you don’t even realize you’re in a tutorial any more. It’s really like the ideal you want people to have, where all of a sudden they just learn by doing and certain things are kind of obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s really what I encourage people to apply to their product design as well. That first five minutes can be highly, highly scripted and full of engagement like a video game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-more-human-experience&quot;&gt;Creating a More Human Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were serving a customer in person, and your product was swapped out in your place, would you have said the same things your product said with the same tone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And almost always that is not the case. Especially looking at what are called blank states or null states. Which is like when maybe you login and the dashboard is where you would see all your projects or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it would say, “you have no projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost admonishing you for not having projects yet. Like I just filled out three forms, I gave you my email address and password, and I’m being scolded. This is not kicking off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly it’s not something you would say if you were standing in the websites place welcoming a new customer to your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s true.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pamela Slim</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This a conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;http://pamelaslim.com/&quot;&gt;Pamela Slim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SeanBlanda&quot;&gt;Sean Blanda&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://99u.com/category/podcast&quot;&gt;99U podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Lately, if I’m thinking about reading a certain book, I’ll look for a podcast or interview with the author to learn more about it. This a perfect example.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean and Pamela discuss her book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Body-Work-Finding-Thread-Together/dp/1591846196&quot;&gt;Body of Work: Finding the Thread That Ties Your Story Together&lt;/a&gt;. After listening, I’ve added this one to my list to read in the near future. Check out an excerpt below and listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://99u.com/articles/28643/the-99u-podcast-job-hunting-with-pamela-slim&quot;&gt;full conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;body-of-work&quot;&gt;Body of Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of our life is to create a body of work that we’re very proud of. And by body of work, I mean everything that we create, that we impact, that we affect, and that we contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the career. So how are we as siblings, and parents, and community members. What do we care about creating - in terms of a feeling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be really tangible things like have you written a book, software code, have you created art pieces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also, what kind of feeling do people in your neighborhood have about you. What kind of emotional path do you leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself on your last day of life looking back, and ask yourself what do you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-all-different&quot;&gt;We’re All Different&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing I know for sure, it’s that none of us are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the constraints that I used for writing the book. Because I know it is not helpful to give advice that says, “Everybody is like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or there is no pre-existing one passion. I’ve met plenty of people from the age of five, knew what they wanted to do. And some of them built a career path for that and they were quite happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we’re jealous of these people or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can have that clarity in your career, but it can mean other parts of your life often show up to have challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is hardly ever a perfect scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is often more useful is when you do start to pay attention to what really interests you. Where do you feel some kind of emotional connection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by emotional connection, it can be things that make you angry. Things that make you sad. Things that bring you joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have heard some of the arguments out there. That totally discount passion and that it’s just a ridiculous life coach-y thing to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is work. I think there is great labor in work that is so worth doing. I’ve been working since I was 12. And I’ve always believed in the suffering part of creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I had to choose between something that actually leveraged my natural strengths, a job that I do that was connected to bigger things in the world that I care about versus a job that didn’t have any of those connections - I’m always going to err of the side of something that is more interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think where we get caught is when we use words like follow your passion or have something you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked many days in my life. But I love working. And I think work can be enjoyable when you are doing things that have meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experience-and-your-ingredients&quot;&gt;Experience and Your Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we miss a lot when we look at our skills when we think about what’s good for a resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So generally you think, what’s my experience that’s not embarrassing. Working at places that people would respect. Or what are my strengths that are socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And often what you miss is a lot of experience that you have, including your scars. Sometimes really difficult personal situations, horrible choices that you’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your whole life. We make a separation between our personal and professional life we have. But I don’t think it’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we come as a whole person. We bring all of ourselves to the world. And our body of work is something that is expressed in many different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think the more we do bring all of ourselves to work, unapologetically - what people look for these days on social media is someone who is authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody once asked me how can I appear more authentic online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s actually a lot of what we’re embracing more. All of those experiences, really reflect on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you do look at traditional things, like your training and your education and places that you’ve worked. But really take into consideration every single part of your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a first generation immigrant? Are you a recovering alcoholic? Did you grow up in poverty? Did you grow up in total wealth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I like the metaphor of ingredients is really any kind of work situation, be it at a job or particularly product that we’re offering at our company, is like a recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at your whole cupboard of ingredients and at different times in your career you can be pulling out different ingredients that you may have in your past that you can be using in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just met so many people that have very interesting, unique, kind of combinations of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you look at a traditional career path, you would say, a lawyer would never use improvisational jazz or something as part of their work. Because lawyers don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you’re thinking a little more creatively about the kind of projects you get involved in. That often is where bringing those other sorts of things forward to your work are going to allow you to be more creative and open up more possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-something&quot;&gt;Create Something&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that we get to know ourselves is in the process of creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people get stuck waiting for the perfect moment, researching everything, trying to find the perfect career, taking every assessment possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never know until you start creating something. So even if what you put on your agenda for the next 12 months, ends up being not at all what you want to do, you’re going to be so much closer to understanding yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move. You have to create. You have to build something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is really what is at the core of &lt;em&gt;Body of Work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pick up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Body-Work-Finding-Thread-Together/dp/1591846196&quot;&gt;Pamela’s book here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bob Moesta</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bmoesta&quot;&gt;Bob Moesta&lt;/a&gt; is the “Milkshake Man.” He’s a designer, engineer, and businessman. He’s known for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6496.html&quot;&gt;Jobs-to-be-Done approach&lt;/a&gt; to business. Bob is who Clayton Christensen calls for advice on this idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out a slew of examples below and listen to the full conversation with Bob and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/asymco&quot;&gt;Horace Dediu&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/19&quot;&gt;Critical Path podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-snickers-vs-milky-way&quot;&gt;Example: Snickers vs. Milky Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the candy isle. For example, the Snickers and the Milky Way. You look at these two and say, “Snickers and Milky Way compete.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re both bar shaped. Both have chocolate. Both play to a certain demographic. They have different performance characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you talk to people about how they actually use Snickers and how they use Milky Way, you find they are very different in situational context. They actually hire them to do very different jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to optimize the two, you try to match attributes for attributes. You try to have focus groups to say what can I do to make Milky Way better? What can I do to make Snickers better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really only in hindsight to how people use it and how people value it that’s really important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you talk to people about Snickers, you find it’s used as a meal replacement. It’s one of those things where they have something to go do and they’re not going to be able to get fuel or energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they’re thinking about a Snickers, their consideration set is completely different. They’re thinking about a soda, a sandwich, an apple. All these other different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about getting me fuel to get me through a moment. It’s about going forward and looking forward. Part of it is it’s designed for that job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Versus a Milk Way, which really if you look at how people hire it, it’s very different. It’s about whether something happened in the past, whether good or bad. It’s taking a moment for themselves. It’s not about fuel. It’s about indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-actually-hire-facebook-to-do&quot;&gt;What You Actually Hire Facebook to Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job is actually technology or product independent. So it allows to start putting new technologies in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a engineer as well, so the rationale of the marketing methods of psychographics and demographics, and need state segmentation, what we found was all association based. But not causality based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs is very much tied around causal, I want this and it causes that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you find is it might be a little hyper-rational. But the fact is when you get to the job and the essence of the job, now you can take new technology and say how they compete with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example is Facebook. What Facebook is doing and why people are hiring it, there are a lot of different jobs that it does. To be clear, I’m only going to talk about one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It actually has replaced the Sunday night phone call. I’m 46 years old. What you would do, is Sunday, you would always call home and find out what was going on at home and you’d tell them what was going on in your life. It was a way of which to connect and see what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has literally become the replacement of that. It’s to stay connected to my family, to be part of their life, even though I’m separated by miles and miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have hired it to do that job of keeping them connected. And to be honest it allows you to connect with the extended family even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disruption&quot;&gt;Disruption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T isn’t thinking about Sunday night calls. Everybody is looking at technology. The fact is the person getting disrupted, doesn’t even know they’re getting disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s seen as such a non-competing industry. And the reality is that true growth comes from pulling from other industries. And doing jobs that other industries are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, that is the power of what jobs looks at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-homes-vs-helping-people-move&quot;&gt;Building Homes vs. Helping People Move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example I can think of is in 2005 I was building industry. We were building homes in the Detroit area. We were the second largest builder in the Metro Detroit area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the company as the VP of Sales and Marketing. The whole thing to me was trying to understand why do people hire our homes, and why our homes over somebody else’s homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to describe to do the methodology is what I did there. Literally every week, I’d sit down with two or three families. I’d bring them pop and pizza. And we’d map out the story of how did they get in this new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d start from the very first thought. Who had the very first thought about moving and when was it. We’d walk through how did they start to look and choose, and what’s everything that is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you find is, the first thing is so interesting, that nobody wants to move. As much as people make it to be a really positive thing, nobody wants to pack up all their stuff and move to somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found there had to be a lot of forces involved in order to get people to move. The methodology we use is about taking and building the timeline from that first thought from what we call passive looking to what we call active looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When do they start to decide, how do they decide, and when they judge satisfaction. It’s about slowing everything way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, it’s almost like moment by moment. When you start to hear the stories, you start to hear patterns. And the patterns start to emerge and help you understand how to move people through that process faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, it’s all about building six scenes in a comic strip from the first thought to the judging satisfaction. And filling that in with very rich detail. The result is some really amazing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, 90 percent of the people who moved in the last year for us, all had the first thought between Thanksgiving and New Years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everybody, said I think it’s time to move. You can understand it’s all about the emotion of the holidays and the reflection of the last year, looking forward. It all makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, we stopped all our advertising November 1st. So when these people were thinking about us, we weren’t advertising. Because nobody bought homes at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was holding people back? We talk about non-consumption. People that wanted to move, but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real difference is we went from building homes to helping people move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we understood that we were about helping people move, we started to change the whole business from having relationships with moving companies and working more with realtor groups. As opposed to trying to get granite and stainless steel appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all about helping people move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our condo business, for example, we found the number one reason people didn’t move was because they didn’t know where the dining room table was going to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was really strange at first. But when you start to look at it, the dining room table is in the emotional bank account of 20, 30, 40 years of every birthday, holiday, everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not going to the basement. And it’s not going to Goodwill. If they couldn’t figure out how to get it to one of their children or family members, and it wasn’t going to fit in the condo, it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we did was redesign our condos to accommodate big, chunky furniture. And they started to realize, I guess our dining room table can fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We increased sales 22 percent making sure the dining room table was right for them. Even though, they didn’t use it anymore. It’s that symbolic piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing we found interesting was there was hesitation around having to go in the basement and dig out 20 or 30 years of history, and pack up and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we did for that was actually increased prices to cover the costs for moving so that moving was standard. So if you bought one of our condos moving was included. And there was no way to discount it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you started to help people understand that moving was a standard and included int the price, people we’re ready to move. It increased our sales 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-many-choices-is-paralyzing&quot;&gt;Too Many Choices is Paralyzing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a model we talk about called the Forces of Progress. We talk about the push of the situation. So some situational context is going to say I need to do something different or better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is then the magnetism of whatever the new idea is. So if there is a push of the situation and no new idea, people don’t make progress. They need to have the idea of what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, every new idea brings anxiety with it. So you need to understand the anxiety that is created when you propose something like moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because all of a sudden it’s like will they be gentle? Are they insured? If they break something, what will happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s all those kind of things that you need to make sure you understand even though choice is important. Too much choice is actually paralyzing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the home building side, we’d sometimes have to make a thousand decisions about cabinets and flooring and carpeting. And simplifying that and saying there is three packages and this is where they fit. Just pick the color and we’ll do everything else for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-choice actually creates more anxiety and non-consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-ask-people-what-they-want&quot;&gt;Don’t Ask People What They Want&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never talk to people about what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the home business. If you sit down in a focus group, you’re going to talk to people about what they want. They’re going to tell you they want 5,000 square feet, five bathrooms, and they start to tell you all these things they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then what happens is you build if for them and they look at you and go, no I can’t afford that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though you try to get people to make decisions in the future, the value code of what they really do is buried in what they actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to abstract things to the right level and understand the job, and how do I actually change my product to fit that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the things we did was build a house that had no basement. Because what we found is that most women don’t like the basement. They don’t want to go into the basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what we found is when we built a house on a slab with the garage on the first floor, and they we’re living on the second floor and then a third floor, we actually found divorced women with children loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they didn’t want to go into the basement to begin with. They didn’t want a basement. They wanted the control to understand where everyone is in the house at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we were able to build it for $130,000. It was one of those things where people said, “No, you can’t build a house on slab because no one will buy it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the reality is there are people who will buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask them do you want a house on a slab? They’re going to say no. But until you see the whole package do you start to realize you can sell a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;descriptive-vs-prescriptive-theory&quot;&gt;Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clay and I working around the difference between descriptive and prescriptive theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptive theory is about trying to pull out all the variables and find the variables. Describe what is actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where prescriptive theory is about how do people put things together and make choices. You’re better off making choices based on this theory than by random chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re really trying to put together the rational and reasoning, I call it the psychics of how people make these decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect, and it’s not 100 percent or 90 percent either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is it’s better than what other methodologies there are today when it comes to designed and launching products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-the-consumer&quot;&gt;Start with the Consumer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple started with the consumer. They started with the people that used the computers. And made computers the way that they wanted. And ignored the secondary buyers, which is the corporate buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All they did was focus on people who bought computers and used them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closer you get to where the buyer and the consumer are connected, you find jobs as very easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s disconnected, like education. If you look at all the products that have been developed for schools in general, it’s all about helping the teacher teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not necessarily focusing on helping the student to learn. When you have an administrator, who is disconnected from the teacher, who is disconnected from the student - the work we do in education is about how do we help the student consume education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we understand how that works. Then we can figure out the new roles of administration and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people go at it as we need to understand what the administrators want and what the teachers want. And then we’ll figure out how to teach because teaching is the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really not. It’s learning. There is a big difference between learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, yes there is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ginny Redish</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ginny Redish is the author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Letting-Words-Second-Edition-Technologies/dp/0123859301/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&quot;&gt;Letting Go of the Words: Writing Web Content that Works&lt;/a&gt;. She is a pioneer in how to communicate on the web. Ginny has helped companies like IBM communicate with customers and teaches people why content is conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/5by5/content-talks/e/content-talks-12-ginny-redish-31579782&quot;&gt;full conversation&lt;/a&gt; with her and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/halvorson&quot;&gt;Kristina Halvorson&lt;/a&gt; on the Content Talks podcast. And find a short excerpt below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-as-conversation&quot;&gt;Content as Conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, in a typical website, your site just doesn’t exist until somebody comes to it. And somebody comes to it because they have a need, they have a question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically they want to start a conversation with your website. And if you’re website does not converse well back to them, they are going to go somewhere else because you’re not satisfying the need that they came with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really came up with the idea of content as conversation in the web arena. But thinking about it, it’s actually what I’ve done for my entire career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is to push people to think of whatever they write as a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer manual, for example, is also a conversation. And if you think through the conversation, that is talking to the other person in your head, you’ll write much better. Whatever you’re writing, don’t think about it as me, me, me. I have all this to say to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because then you’re just shouting into a void and not working with the other person who is involved with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-web-is-for-self-service&quot;&gt;The Web is for Self-Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most people started their websites on the metaphor of a filing cabinet. Whether they made that explicit or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they were really doing was putting up all of their documents and sort of saying, “Here are our filing cabinets. We’ll open the doors and let you rummage around them yourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that is a very poor metaphor for a website. Because people don’t come to the website for documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They come for information. They come to get answers to their questions. They come to have these conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therefore what I think the web really should be and has been, the web is a telephone. The web is all about self-service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a sense, the web is replacing customer service calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-like-a-human&quot;&gt;Write Like A Human&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content as conversation actually starts before you think about what you’re going to write or say. It’s just that concept that there is another human being in this with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t only about what I have to say, it’s about hearing the other person in your head as you’re writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the person you’re in this conversation with. And imagine their lives. It’s not only who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the idea that someone is going to be coming at 11 o’clock at night, when they’re tired and the bank is closed, and there is no way to ask a question. And they really need to accomplish this transaction. They’re tired. The kids have been put to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine this person and they’re emotional attitude. And so when you’re writing, you really are communicating with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-want-to-achieve-by-writing-this&quot;&gt;What Do You Want To Achieve By Writing This?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people think of it as I have this content to say. And don’t realize that in the workplace, everything from an email to a webpage is actually serving some purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s getting people to buy something or stop doing something, or getting your proposal funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s such a different situation then the way we were all writing in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just getting people to realize what they write is supposed to achieve something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must write: when someone reads this, they will do “x”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when you read this, you will &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks, Ginny.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a conversation between Tim Ferriss and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kk.org/&quot;&gt;Kevin Kelly&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fourhourworkweek.com/category/the-tim-ferriss-show/&quot;&gt;Tim Ferriss Show&lt;/a&gt;. A college dropout, Kevin shares his story of living overseas, doing LSD at 50 years old, and what he’s learned along the way. Kevin is the Senior Maverick at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/&quot;&gt;Wired Magazine&lt;/a&gt; and known for other projects like &lt;a href=&quot;http://kk.org/cooltools/&quot;&gt;Cool Tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is an excerpt of a three-part conversation. It just scratches the surface. Make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/08/29/kevin-kelly/&quot;&gt;listen to all three parts&lt;/a&gt;, as Ferriss says, “Kevin Kelly might be the real-life Most Interesting Man In The World.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://traffic.libsyn.com/timferriss/TIMFERRISSSHOW028KELLYpt3.mp3&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-youre-young-get-involved-in-slack&quot;&gt;When You’re Young, Get Involved in Slack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got involved in starting Wired and running Wired for awhile. And hired a lot of people coming right out of college. They were interns and they would do the intern thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were good, and we would hire them. Which basically means after 10 years or whatever, this was their first and only job. I just remember telling them, “Why are you here?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?” You should be fooling around, wasting time, trying something crazy. “Why are you working a real job?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really recommend slack. I’m a big believer in this kind of doing something that’s not productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity is for the middle ages. When you’re young, you want to be prolific and make and do things. But you don’t want to measure them in terms of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to measure them in terms of extreme performance. You want to measure them in extreme satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a time to try stuff. Explore the possibilities. And there are so many possibilities and there is more every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-dont-need-much-to-be-happy&quot;&gt;You Don’t Need Much to Be Happy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the life skills that you want to learn at a young age, is the skill of being ultra thrifty, minimal. In a sense of how little you actually need to live not just in survival mode, but in a contented mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that pretty early by backpacking and doing other things, especially through Asia, that I could be very happy with very, very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You build your own house, live in a shelter or tiny house. You don’t need very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think trying that out, building your house on the pond like Thoreau, who was a hero of mine in high school, is not just a simple exercise, but a profound exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it allows you to get over that anxiety. Even if you aren’t living like that, you know that if the worse came to worse, you could keep going at a very low rate. And be content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gives you the confidence to take a risk. Because what’s the worse that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing that once or twice, you don’t necessarily have to live like that, but know you can be content, is tremendously empowering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-to-think&quot;&gt;Write to Think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers have done a lot of studies where they have kids write an essay on something, an assignment. And then they would also be instructed to write an email to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they would grade both of the compositions. They would find inevitably the email that the kids were writing was much better writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you’re trying to write a composition, we have all these attitudes or expectations. There is kind of a writerly sense. There is all this other garbage and luggage. And baggage on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when we’re just trying to write an email, we’re directly trying to communicate something. We’re not fooling around or trying to make it literally. It’s just direct stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the writing there was always much more direct and concrete. That’s the usual thing that happens when you write, is you’re not concrete enough. But when you email, it’s all concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I discovered, and what a lot of writers discover, is I write to think. It was like I think I have an idea, but when I begin to write it, I realize I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I actually don’t know what I think, until I try to write it. So writing is a way for me to find out what I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like I don’t have any ideas. It’s true. But when I write, I get the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an idea generation machine. Writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;money-is-overrated&quot;&gt;Money is Overrated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is so overrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is lot to be said about it. One is obviously if you’re struggling to pay bills, mortgages, or whatever there is a certain amount that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here is the thing, accumulating enough money to do things is really a byproduct of doing other things. It’s kind of a lubricant in a certain sense rather than a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And great wealth, extreme wealth, is definitely overrated. I’ve had meals with a dozen billionaires and their lifestyles are no different, you don’t want to have a billion dollars, let me put it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing that you can really do with it that you can’t with a lot less money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things you want to do, the things that will make you content, the things that will satisfy you, the things that will bring you meaning, can usually get better without having money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of time or a lot of money, it’s always better to have a lot of time to do something. If you had a choice between having a lot of friends and a lot of money, you would definitely want to have a lot of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in a way technological progress is diminishing the role of money. I want to be clear that I’m talking about money beyond the amount you need to survive. But even that reflects back to what we were saying either that it’s probably less than you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people see money as this means to get things. But there are these other routes to these other things. That are deeper, and more constant, and more durable, and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is this very small, one-dimensional thing. That if you focus on that, it kind of comes and goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If whatever it is you’re trying to attain, if you go at it more directly, through other means, you’ll probably wind up with a more powerful experience or whatever it is that you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will be deeper, more renewable then coming at it with money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel is one of the great examples. Many people are working very hard, saving their money to retire, to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to flip it around and travel when I was really young. And had zero money. I had experiences that even a billion dollars couldn’t of bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fully human, we have to have our future. We have to look forward to the future. That is part of us. It’s looking into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of embrace that. That future forward facing, that’s what I do and what I write about. In thinking about the future, it’s very hard because the paradox of the future is that there are lots of impossible things that happen all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone 100 years from now were to come back and tell us things, there is a lot of stuff were just not going to believe. Stuff that’s just crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just like if we went back 100 years, and told them what was going on now, they would say that’s just not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could even go back 20 years, and say we’re going to have Google Street Views of all the cities of the world. And we’re going to have an encyclopedia for free, that’s edited by anybody. They would say there is no way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would tell them most of it is for free. They would say there is no economic model in the world that would allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there isn’t. But here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the dilemma is any true forecast about the future is going to be dismissed. Any future that is believable now is going to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-sabbaths&quot;&gt;Technology Sabbaths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned from them [the Amish], when we had younger kids, is we had technological sabbaticals or sabbaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now seen other families who aren’t even religious adopt that same thing, which is once a week you take a break from however you define it - the screen, keyboard, or connectivity or something. And you step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do that not because it’s terrible or poison, but because it’s so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of people who say they’re going to drop out from Twitter because this is a toxin and I need to detox or something. I think that is entirely the wrong way to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to take breaks from this, not because they’re toxic, but because they are so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to step back, so you can re-enter it with a renewed perspective, with a renewed appreciation, and having spent time looking at it in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-successful-means&quot;&gt;What Successful Means&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success is also overrated. Greatness is overrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we tend to have an image of success that’s somewhat been skewed by our current media. It’s like our sense of beauty, in terms of all possibilities, it’s in a very small, narrow, defined way. It’s almost ritualistic in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think our definition of success is today somebody who has a lot of money or somebody who has a lot of fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think really being successful means being true to yourself. And being the most “you” that you could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great temptation that people have is they want to be someone else, which is basically they want to be in someone else’s movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to be the best rock star. And there are so many of those already. That you can only end up imitating someone in that slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, success is you make your own slot. You have a new slot that didn’t exist before. That’s really hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s what I chalk up as success, is you make a new slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-decide-what-books-to-read&quot;&gt;How to Decide What Books to Read&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like what are you going to listen to new in music. I think the music becomes free and everybody has access to all the music in the world. But deciding what you’re going to listen to becomes the thing you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been my prediction about Amazon. That we’re soon going to have any book you want for free. Amazon Prime. Digital version of it, you can have it, whatever you want. But you’ll pay us [Amazon] for the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a network of friends, I listen to lots of podcasts, so I get it from all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I long ago decided that, in terms of the greater schemes of things, the cost of books were really cheap. And that if I wanted a book, that I would buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is now I’m speaking in a two-story high library of books that I have. I don’t do the same with digital books because I finally figured out that if I purchased a digital book before reading it, it’s not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not going anywhere it’s just sitting there. So I really shouldn’t purchase a digital book until like five seconds before I’m going to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cultivating-a-paper-library&quot;&gt;Cultivating a Paper Library&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was near to the point of actually digitizing and getting rid of all my paper books. I was that close about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I had an epiphany when I went to a private library. And I realized books were never as cheap as they are right today. And they never will be as cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some power about having these things in paper, always available, no batteries, never obsolete. And if you made a library now, you’d never be able to make some of these libraries in 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to keep and kind of cultivate this paper library as something that was going to be very powerful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovery-and-invention&quot;&gt;Discovery and Invention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a very high dimensional space, which means a space of lots of possibilities, the act of finding and the act of creating are identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no difference between discovery something and inventing something. We could say, that philosophically, that Benjamin Franklin invented electricity. We could say that Christopher Columbus invented America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could say that discovery and invention are the same. So that discovering yourself and inventing yourself is really the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same things will bring about that process. You have to do both at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, he’s the most interesting man in the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jenn Lim</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a talk with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DHMovementCEO&quot;&gt;Jenn Lim&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.33voices.com/&quot;&gt;33 Voices podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Jenn is a a former consultant to Zappos and created the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zapposinsights.com/culture-book&quot;&gt;Zappos Culture Book&lt;/a&gt;. She later helped launch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Tony-Hseih-ebook/dp/B007GATVYI/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1408994619&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=delivering+happiness&quot;&gt;Tony Hsieh’s book&lt;/a&gt;, Delivering Happiness, and since transformed that concept into a company. Today, Jenn is the CEO and Chief Happiness Officer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://deliveringhappiness.com/&quot;&gt;Delivering Happiness&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.33voices.com/interviews/delivering-happiness&quot;&gt;full podcast here&lt;/a&gt; and check out the excerpt below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;misconceptions-about-happiness&quot;&gt;Misconceptions about Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not all about rainbows and unicorns. Some people think when they hear happiness, especially those who are skeptical about what we’re doing, just think that’s great for you guys if you have this culture that’s everyone doing whatever they want to do or wearing whatever they want to wear - if that means happiness for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second misconception is happiness is fluffy. Now more than ever because of the science of happiness and cognitive psychology, we have more data and research that shows there are more ways to increase our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is not the short-term fleeting happiness that we all know about. Every day pleasures like going out and grabbing drinks with friends or buying a pair of shoes. Those are forms of happiness, but not sustainable ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with all this data we know that happiness can be defined in more meaningful ways. And that includes stuff like having more meaningful connections with people in your life, having a sense of control in your decisions, and having a sense of progress that you’re growing and developing. Having passions - your states of flow increase when you’re happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ultimately what all the research shows it’s having a sense of higher purpose. That is really what sustains that long-term happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zappos-path-to-happiness&quot;&gt;Zappos Path to Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people assume Zappos had it figured out from day one. And of course, that wasn’t the case. In fact, they didn’t start focusing on culture and core values to year five or year six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I saw working with Zappos was a tiny little startup. All it wanted to do was make money and sell a lot of shoes. That’s kind of endemic of all the startups at that time. But then Zappos kind of matured over the next couple years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It decided, you know what, we don’t want to just be a shoe seller - we want to focus on customer service. And be the best at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it matured again a couple years later, and said you know what if we want to grow and sustain what we have today, it’s not actually about customer service. It’s about us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about company culture. It’s about employees. It’s about making sure that is solid first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because of the stages that Zappos went through that first, it was a startup. Bottom line - we’ve got to make money or we won’t be here and we can’t survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then realizing we want to be bigger and better than that. It’s not just about shoes. It’s about customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there was a point, just a light bulb, hey if this is going to continue and we want to grow the team - knowing that most of the time when you grow the people the culture actually deteriorates, how do you address that in advance? So you can not just grow the team and scale the culture, but actually make it better in time with more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s when all the core values and the culture book, the Zappos you see today, made that transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-start-culture-and-happiness&quot;&gt;How to Start Culture and Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one was defining core values. Going back further than that, first comes commitment. It’s sounds kind of simple, but until you commit to these values or culture as an organization, it’s not going to last. It’s not going to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all too easy to say, when times get rough, and you’ve got to cut stuff out of the budget the first to go is usually always HR and culture. So number one is commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the second thing is defining those core values. It’s sounds like an easy thing to do. For some companies, it’s an offsite deal in the woods with senior management. And then come back, and say here’s our core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for Zappos and Delivering Happiness, and now all of our clients, what we say is that take your time to do it. And for both the companies I just mentioned, it took a full year to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a process for everyone in the company to submit their own personal core values and then refining them overtime to make sure they actually stand up to what is actually unique about your culture and your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know not everyone is able to define their core values. Because I know they might say, “hey that’s good for startups, but I’m actually a company that’s been around for awhile.” So what we say there is can you revisit your core values? Can you ask yourself if you’re actually living by your core values?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culture book is asking everyone in the company to write a couple paragraphs as to what culture means to them. What we do is we print it. Totally unedited. The good and bad are both in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question to ask yourself as a company is would you be willing to print, unedited, what your employees think about your culture? I’d say 95 percent of the time the people I talk to would say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the things I’d start with - those are the building blocks of where we start talking about culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happiness-means&quot;&gt;What Happiness Means&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness is so subjective. What I boil it down to and what I see is the difference between someone who can sustain their happiness and someone who has highs and lows, what we call a rockstar happiness. Where someone is chasing the next high and usually says stuff like “I’ll be happy when I achieve this or when I get that raise.” Those are the people that have peaks or come down pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I see is when people are truly, genuinely true to themselves. True to their weird self. In a sense that they are unique to who they are and they live it out. That’s step number one in understanding what your long-term happiness can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really those people who are authentic to what is good and bad about them. That sort of kick starts the whole journey into what happiness can mean to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re fearful that someone is going to see you as not smart or not serious because I’m smiling too much, than that’s already a natural roadblock into how happy that person can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at different sort of leaders out there and which ones are effective and are leaders people respect, it’s those that are really true to who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think now more than ever, those people who are authentic to themselves, are ones that really shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-shift-the-culture&quot;&gt;How to Shift the Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At large institutions, it’s so crucial to have commitment at the leadership level. But not just by words. It has to come through actions too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the biggest thing we’ve seen is this word culture - it’s such a buzzword all over now in the global workforce. But hardly any companies really get it. In terms of really wanting to sustain it overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the biggest thing on that level is don’t just talk about it. Actually do something about it too. Because that’s what’s really eroding the culture now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why 87 percent of the workforce is disengaged with their work. This is a study that Gallop did in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s because there is so much lip service being paid. Oh yeah, “we believe in you,” we want employees to be engaged. But then come the next quarter those programs that we supposedly going to help these kind of things fade away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing on that level is to do what you say you’re going to do. And lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because only then will all the other managers and employees will get engaged and actually believe there will be real change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-help-people-that-are-unhappy&quot;&gt;How to Help People that are Unhappy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just basic human understanding and basic human needs. I ask this question everywhere I go and I talk around the world about this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I ask how many people in the room believe they can sustain their own happiness? Predictably sustain it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what, one to five percent of the room raises their hand. No matter where in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start thinking about how to address it, you start thinking about the very simple things of environment change. And these things that don’t require a huge amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really about coming back to we know you have a lot of things going on in your life and it’s not just about work. So how can we as an organization help you think about your own personal happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we know it all starts with the individual. We have a choice, based on the science, 40 to 90 percent of your happiness is based on your own control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a leader of an organization, how do we embrace that and create an environment that says, “hey, you can be yourself.” We have a lot of goals that we need to make. We have a lot of work that we need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we have this mutual understanding that we’re all in it together - it changes our whole intention and the way you inter-relate with each other and your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happiness is contagious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Allan is the co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://lessaccounting.com/&quot;&gt;Less Accounting&lt;/a&gt;. He shares his story and the family businesses that influenced him along the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After reading this excerpt, you’ll want to high five Allan. It’s incredible advice. Check out his site &lt;a href=&quot;http://massalinadrive.com/&quot;&gt;Massalina Drive&lt;/a&gt; and follow along with the presentation at these two links: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV_WUfk_0As&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3G5uLwtneI&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##5 Things My Parents Taught Me About Business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents never sat down and said, “Allan, these are tips you need to know one day. You’re going to start a Internet company. And it’s going to be really a lot of work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They never said that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve observed things. And it’s taken me 30 years to see how these things that we’ve done naturally, my business partner and I - it’s come naturally because I’ve observed things the way my parents have done them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just seems natural to me. So these are some tips they’ve shown me, not through business lessons, they’ve shown me these things every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve consistently showed me these messages. And here’s what I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-extraordinary-and-work-your-ass-off&quot;&gt;Be Extraordinary and Work Your Ass Off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is be extraordinary. This isn’t an inspirational talk. And that sounds really fucking cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my parents wanted me to do something that I loved. And cared about and was passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up as a home schooler, my mom constantly still tries to show us things and teach us things. And we hated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d say, “stop teaching us things. You’re driving me crazy, Mom. Gosh, you’re ruining my life. Uhh! I’m going to my room.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she wanted us to be extraordinary. And I hope we came close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first lesson is work your ass off. My parents never said, “it’s ok, you don’t have to work as hard as the other guy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents made us work harder than everyone else. Every Saturday while you were playing Nintendo, my family was working at our family business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcom Gladwell has a great book called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930&quot;&gt;Outliers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And in his book &lt;em&gt;Outliers&lt;/em&gt;, he says to be world class in anything you need 10,000 hours of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you can’t be gifted initially. But to be world class in something, you need to put 10,000 hours in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think I’ve done that. I’m there in business now. Kind of understanding what business is about now just at age 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my parents always told us, “you’re going to have to work harder than everyone else. When everyone else is out playing, you’re going to have to work hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And nothing in life comes easy. Business is a struggle. I watched my dad struggle every week to make payroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washing cars was not a glorious business by any means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of being extraordinary is if people think you’re doing something crazy, you’re probably on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because most people are morons. Most people are morons. They sell insurance - they do this, they do that. They look forward to being 65 when they can actually take a day off and forget about work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re not going to get you spending nights and weeks working on a project that may or may not ever make a dime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you’re doing, to them - you’re crazy. You are crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew I was doing something right, when my mother in-law said, “you should keep your job. You don’t need to go freelance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said, “I’m probably doing the right thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ballsy-things-change-the-status-quo&quot;&gt;Ballsy Things Change the Status Quo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize crazy things. Not crazy as in idiotic. But crazy as in ballsy. Ballsy things get talked about. Ballsy things change the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather, when he opened his restaurant in 1943 there was nothing like it. He opened it in Panama City, FL. 3,000 people in this little town. And it’s still there today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;65 years later - it’s still there. People still come in. He has pictures of himself still on the wall, his employees, and other restaurants that he’s owned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still there. It’s still there because he focused on having a good product. A product that was different than everyone else. And he focused on having a niche market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car washes - there wasn’t even a car wash industry in 1953. This was uncharted territory. He went into a new category business. Bankers didn’t give loans for car washes. There was only about 20 car washes in all the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he didn’t go out and build a laundry mat. There is nothing wrong with laundry mats. But he went out a built a car wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was probably a car wash - three or four in the southeast. One in Miami, one in Atlanta, and probably Nashville. But this is Panama City, FL. He put one here and it’s still here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-have-customers-have-friends&quot;&gt;Don’t Have Customers. Have Friends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing is you don’t have customers. You have friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do have customers. But I want people to stop using the term customers and users. Because it dehumanizes the people that you’re serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather, every ad he ever put out, “howdy friend.” Put his picture on it. His name. It was more like he was talking to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to have more friends. You need to treat your customers like they’re your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you want your best friend treated coming into your application by your support team, by your developer - how would you want them treated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you explain your app to them. How would you allow them to understand what your app does? Treat them like friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ilikevests&quot;&gt;Kevin Hale&lt;/a&gt;, from wufoo.com, has a great quote. “I just imagine every tech support request is coming from a beautiful girl.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He actually says Halle Berry. And it changes my tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the people sending you emails for feature requests and bug reports is Halle Berry or your best friend, maybe Halle Berry is your best friend, you will change your tone and you will give them more respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will feel the love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as customer loyalty. Your customers will not be loyal. Friends are loyal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/09/loyalty.html&quot;&gt;great blog post&lt;/a&gt; the other day that said, “loyalty is when people know there are other choices, better choices, and they stick with you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t even look for other choices. They stick with you because they love you and they love your brand. And they love everything you’re doing and they want to support you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather showed me this and we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/19407?token=SqMCOTWz4g67J8cIaSJa5mN6rX0KX-fddtp-pDx3monLYcb04IsKy6LcTL5auBv6EoHGJfMTuM-fOtEyAeTUIaU&quot;&gt;copied this&lt;/a&gt; - this is my business partner, Steve. He is the smartest man in the world. We give out stickers that say we’re your new best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We send out emails that say, “hey friend.” We want to be your friend. We don’t have fans. We don’t have followers. We have friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s been really helpful for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk to our users. When you login to Less Accounting it says, “You’re back, we love you. No seriously, you’re awesome.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that could be just, “login form, please fill everything out that’s required.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s robot talk. Talk to these people like they’re your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-branding&quot;&gt;Personal Branding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go to personal branding - it just makes me want to vomit. We’re now in a time where people are coining phrases, terms, or terminology for things that have been going on for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Vaynerchuk and Chris Brogan, and all the social media people did not invent personal branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. It’s just when your customers know who you are and trust the product you built them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the early 1800s or 1900s, when you go to Smith’s General Store. And Mr. Smith is behind the counter and he says, “you should try this lip balm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know Mr. Smith’s recommendation is the best. That’s a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been doing personal branding forever. Hershey’s. JC Penney. People used to name their business after themselves as a part of being branding. So you would trust the Disney brand, the JC Penney brand, which was a huge catalog that had lots and lots of products in it, so you had to trust the products they had it in were really good. They had an R&amp;amp;D laboratory setup to test these products. So you knew if JC Penney put his stuff in that catalog - it was the best stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firestone. Kellog’s. You saw a lot more apostrophe “s’s”. I’m not going out there and saying you need to name your web app, “Eddy’s web app.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s a way people put their name and face on their product. And it worked. It worked well for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They kept copying these people until it got so big their face or their name of the company no longer represented the person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kellog’s guy died off. And you don’t think of the face of the man of Kellog’s anymore. You think of the little chicken or rooster or whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these companies got really big and they got faceless and nameless. And we thought well that’s what we should do as business owners in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your brand is how your customers explain you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather, if you look at his ads, he talks about how he’s helping working class families. He wanted to help working class families feed their families and keep their cars clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which reminds me of Grasshopper Group. It’s the parent company of Grasshopper.com, which is the phone system, and also Chargify, which helps you do reoccurring billing. They’re not Grasshopper Group - we build apps. It’s we empower entrepreneurs with the tools that we provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the story that they’re selling. That’s the brand that they’re selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build a brand. But how the fuck do you build a brand? No one tells you how to build a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it takes years and years and years. Every day doing the right things and being good. Your brand is your aftermath of all of your actions that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s how you talk to people. It’s how you dress. And it’s how your app works. It’s how you resolve issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing Kevin Hale says, “the relationship between your users and you is a marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All marriages have problems. But it’s how you resolve these problems that makes a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what makes a relationship is how you resolve quarrels and tiffs with your friends or with your wife or husband or however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your brand comes from years and years of doing the same thing. It’s not your fucking logo. It’s not your logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather did all these things. He put his name on things. He said thank you. The businesses had much more life. They had birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of his ads had a little paragraph or little letter from him. That was how he built his brand. He built his brand on good prices. And a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the very bottom of this ad, just above Jimmys’, it says see the world’s most unusual juke organ. Now, I don’t know what a juke organ is - but it sounds fucking fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one of his brands was world’s biggest hamburger. We have big food. It’s cheap prices. We’re good people. It’s very clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read back to one of his car hop manuals. The car hop is the person who goes and takes your order and runs back inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said change your hat every two days. They used to wear little hats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your customer is not going to notice your pants. But they’re going to notice that hat. Because they are going to try to look at you in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are going to know if there is stains or sweat. So they’re going to notice your hat. Change your hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neat and clean stuff, the price, was all part of the brand he built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;identify-value&quot;&gt;Identify Value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was able to identify value. And he did it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t identify value quickly, you’re going to go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad took over the car washes in the late ’70s before I was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go into Starbucks or any coffee shop and you’ve been a few times, and the barista says, “hey whatever your name is - that venti caramel latte with the extra puff of foam.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how you like it. When they remember your drink, you’re like, “holy shit, this is awesome.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You feel really good. It makes you feel really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad realized this in the ’80s and he would basically pay his employees to remember the names of his customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s a picture of a couple employees who had the highest name count with a couple trophies. It was a big deal. I think the winner at one point had 130 names, tag numbers, and make/model of cars remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made the customer feel really good. He was able to identify that value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late ’80s he kept this naming system. He had a high school kid in BASIC build a database to store customer names, tag numbers, make/models, notes, mailing address, birthdays - all that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you could pull in and they would greet you and say, “hey Mr. Smith I know you came in a couple weeks ago and asked for this specific wash. And asked to make sure the cup holders were clean. But would you like to add hot wax?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So knowing they’re going to take care of you and make sure the little things that you wanted done would get done built a lot of loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gave them a lot of emotional value to feel safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that is a car wash standard. That’s why my dad is really well known in the car wash business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad goes to car wash conventions and meetings. He’s like the Tim O’Reilly of car wash conventions. People take their pictures with him and it’s funny. And really it’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing about car washes. When you’re watching your car being washed, the foam is going everywhere - it’s blue and it’s green. It’s foamy. It smells like pine. And there’s bubbles or soap or strawberries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemicals don’t make the bubbles. That’s actually an additive they add to make the customer feel really, really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might not have anything to do with it, but it makes the customer feel really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at Less Accounting, I added a little welcome mat to the app. It says, “hey your account is created, welcome to bookkeeping in the clouds, let’s get started buddy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes people feel really good. It’s the simplest little thing and it make them feel so good. It’s how we identify value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about welcome mats, foam, people using your name - all these values. You obviously need to have a good product, but all these values come from one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s emotional value. It’s being able to identify what makes your customer feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you screw up the product and you have a welcome mat, but your app doesn’t work, then it really doesn’t fucking matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re able to deliver a good product, then identify emotional values of how the customer can feel better. And how they want to feel. You’re going to have a more successful product and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stay-in-business-by-not-spending-money&quot;&gt;Stay in Business by Not Spending Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to tell you how to stay in business. It’s by not spending money. It’s taken me 30 years to realize this. It’s a simple point. Why do businesses go out of business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it because they have a really ugly logo? No, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it because there website is really ugly? No, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it because they have really stupid marketing? No, it’s not that either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s because they’ve spent more money than they’re making. And they’re running out of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run out of money, your business is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to go even as far as predicting how your business is going to go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, if you’re a business owner, you’re weeks away or months away from going out of business, losing your house, losing your cars, and living with your fucking mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the money stops today, what are you going to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about how much cash you have saved. You might have a great product. And you might say, “Allan you’re talking to somebody else, I’ve got a great product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few things that has happened to my family over the last few years that has created cash flow issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City regulations that’s added extra expenses into the car wash business. Out of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother contracted Lime disease three years ago. They have health insurance, but they also owed $300,000 in medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Oil spill. I’m in Panama City, FL. You should come down here and see what it has done to the economy. These people might have great businesses down here, but because the oil spill they were shit out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These outside cashflow issues can come from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can deliver a fantastic product and it may never happen to you. But I can guarantee you that all the other tips people are going to tell you - you may have another speaker come in here and contradict what I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no one that’s been in business longer than a few years, we’ll ever tell you that you should have less cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have less cash. You should spend more money. No. People that go out of business spend money on things they think are important. And they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that you think are important probably are not as important as you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to predict how you’re going to go out of business. You’re going to open a consultancy or a web app and it’s going to do well. You’re going to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to be working for a few years and you’re going to get some more notoriety, and it’s going to be good. You’re going to say I’m working a lot of hours. I deserve a bump, a little bit of a raise, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to feel good. Money is a great temporary justification of doing something you don’t really want to do. So you’re going to give yourself a little bit of a raise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to hire someone. You’re going to get a bigger office, a nicer car. Because you want your friends to realize how well you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly want my friends to realize how well I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to have a time - it might be five years from now, 10 years, or even two years. There’s going to be a cash flow hiccup. You’re going to get sued. You’re going to get sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something is going to happen where you have a cash flow issue. And it’s going to be how well you prepared yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save money. Both personally and in the business. You need to have three months personal and three months business to last you in case something happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or this will allow you not to take projects on that you don’t want to take if you’re doing consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;figure-out-what-is-important&quot;&gt;Figure Out What is Important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be young. You might be old. You might have kids. I don’t know. But I have two kids and I’ve got a wife. We’ve been married awhile. Seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell you I love business and I love design, but I can tell that our work is not nearly as important as this [family]. As soon as you realize business and work is a tool to allow you to do other things - the happier you will become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the less dependent, the things that we get so upset about can wait until tomorrow. You can take the afternoon off. Play with your kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even catch myself playing with my kids and thinking about business and it’s terrible. I have to tell myself now is kid time and you have to be there for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents, my dad missed so many hours growing up. He missed soccer games and baseball games. But he set an expectation of I would rather be there watching you, but I have to earn a living so we can have a house over your head. So your brothers and sisters can buy books. And I’m going to be there every time I can. But there is going to be times where I have to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I never resented him. He set a great expectation for me. And I hope I create a great expectation for my wife and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-your-legacy&quot;&gt;Build Your Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather passed away in 1963. So I never met my grandfather. My dad was 10 years old when he died. So I might have learned a lot more, who knows, if he would of been around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s kind of cool and what makes me more proud of family is thinking about how grandfather did all these things 65 years ago and how they’ve affected me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He passed away in ‘63 in a car wreck. He set up his business where he had lists, he had 10 restaurants and two car washes at the time, he had these lists of all the things he needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesdays, Jimmy’s on Harrison Avenue gets these things. You’re going to need to have these things. The car wash needs to have these chemicals on these dates. Pay people on these dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how much a roof cost me to build. He had these ledgers of information that my grandmother used to run the businesses forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So another tip might be to find someone to replace you. Or make your job automated. He certainly did that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandmother lived off his work for 25 years and sent my dad to college. All these things my cousins have done because of my grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s cheesy, but maybe I should challenge you to build your legacy and go out and do things that your grandkids will take about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s affected me. I’m more proud of my family than I am myself. The way my dad treated customers and diffused situations. He has employees that have worked for him for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You walk through the hall ways of his car wash and see pictures of employees and remodels. People would quit and then come back. He built a day care for his employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just amazing to watch him do things. A lot of these don’t relate to the Internet and what we’re doing. But certainly it was a unique way to grow up and a unique way to look at business.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nicolefenton.com&quot;&gt;Nicole Fenton&lt;/a&gt; is a guest on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happymondaypodcast.com/&quot;&gt;Happy Monday Podcast&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshlong&quot;&gt;Josh Long&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swazzy&quot;&gt;Sarah Parmenter&lt;/a&gt;. Nicole designs with words. She is excellent communicator working with companies from Apple to Facebook. The trio talks her book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nicelysaid.co/&quot;&gt;Nicely Said&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored with &lt;a href=&quot;http://katekieferlee.com/&quot;&gt;Kate Kiefer Lee&lt;/a&gt; and other philosophies behind writing. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happymondaypodcast.com/episodes/3485-episode-74-nicole-fenton&quot;&gt;full conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;starting-from-the-bottom&quot;&gt;Starting from the bottom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to be a writer when I was very young. I have an English degree and kind of come from a nerdy, technology family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of my parents met in a engineering test lab. So there is a little bit of technical expertise in my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to to advertising writing. I wasn’t going to go into a marketing masters or anything after I got my English degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought about which company I wanted to work for no matter what I would be writing and I decided to try to work at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, they weren’t really hiring writers off the street. Unless if you had a lot of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I applied to work at the call center. And started at the bottom and answered phones and emails. Eventually, kind of worked my way up to basically running the content side of the website for the organization I was working in, which was the online store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just started at the bottom. Which would be something I recommend to anyone who’s not sure how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nicely-saidhttpwwwnicelysaidco&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nicelysaid.co/&quot;&gt;Nicely Said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate and I really wanted to write the book we wish we had when we started our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kind of think of it as not a manual or workbook. Some writing books are very high level and inspirational. We tried to go somewhere in between those two things of this is how you write and writing is the best thing in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things you will learn from this book are actually how to do the work of owning your communications. And communicating clearly and kindly. Sticking to your true voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate and I both really care about &lt;a href=&quot;http://voiceandtone.com/&quot;&gt;voice and tone&lt;/a&gt;, and showing empathy to the reader. Lately, I’ve been talking about it as turning your chair or swiveling your chair and actually talking to the people your talking &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; them. Which is what a lot of companies do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They [companies] talk a lot about themselves. And they don’t really think of their customers first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are the kinds of things we tried to focus on. And we do go through practical - what is the research you do, how do you make a creative brief or a project brief, how do you actually do the writing itself, taking out the passive voice where it doesn’t work or cutting jargon. Those kind of line level designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then also go through all the content types that most web writers or designers or CEOs or bloggers would need to be thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also cover how to make a style guide, which I think a lot of people are interested in, but aren’t sure how to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just dealing with the editing process in a large or small organization. Where you have everyone invested in the content, but nobody seems to know how to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problems-with-writing-on-the-web&quot;&gt;The Problems with Writing on the Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes companies know what they want to say, but they don’t know how to say it. They talk about themselves or they just don’t think in terms of the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is such a design drum that we beat every day. Think about the user. What are they trying to do? Where do they come from? What might they be feeling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and time again companies have a plan about what they want to say, but I think because of silos or stress or short-deadlines or unreasonable deadlines, it’s often let’s throw something at the wall and see if it sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s not really the way to make good content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-were-taught-to-write&quot;&gt;How We’re Taught to Write&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, clients come to me saying they don’t want to do that. But they find themselves doing it. Because they don’t know how to do the other thing, which is the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever that might be for their readers. So then you get people saying “we’re the industry leading, blah, blah.” It’s just meaningless crap honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job is to teach them how to talk about themselves in a way that isn’t alienating to their customers. And also work towards their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not super complicated. But if you don’t know how to do it and you’re trained in as a MBA - I don’t know. The way we’re taught to write in college is not the way the business world works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-your-human-side&quot;&gt;Show Your Human Side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Kate and I are always trying to advocate. Be you. Show your human side. That’s what people want to see and identify with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t want this monolithic wall to talk to like airlines and DMVs or banks. Nobody wants that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that showing your errors and admitting to them, a good apology can take your customers from liking you or being skeptical to being very loyal and passionate about what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really funny common sense from the customer service ops world. That we’re trying to bring to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show your customers you care. Don’t give them a blanket apology. Or I apologize for the frustration you may of felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that dismissive, we’re not taking responsibility because our lawyers are choking us kind of thing. That just doesn’t work for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-examples-of-writing&quot;&gt;Good Examples of Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of good examples in the book. What Pinterest is doing, and Kate loves this company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quinnpopcorn.com/&quot;&gt;Quinn Popcorn&lt;/a&gt;. They’re a small family that makes popcorn and their doing great stuff. Just the way they put these touches on product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href=&quot;http://getharvest.com/&quot;&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, which is an invoicing software service. But they have very clear help documentation. And there interface is very clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as someone who uses their service, I enjoy paying for it. And they don’t annoy me with emails that I don’t need. They know their place in my life, which is I am paying you to hold my hours and my invoices for my clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; is doing a really good job with broader storytelling work. Instead of talking about themselves so much, they show the work of the people that use Etsy and sell on Etsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I think is the right way to promote yourself. It’s to show how you’re helping other people and the cool stuff they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-need-more-writers&quot;&gt;We Need More Writers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they’re is a little bit of a stigma around the stuff that I do. People think help center documentation or error messages or interface labels - that’s not sexy right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But honestly I really enjoy making things clear for people. And I think that is a skill a lot of people don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we need a lot more writers. I can not find enough web writers these days to refer work to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge gap between where we are and how good it could be if more people were working on content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;book-recommendations&quot;&gt;Book Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of things in connected fields. I like to read about design and writing and editing - I don’t just stick to the books that say “for the web” on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few books that have made an impression on me. Everybody loves Anne Lamott’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016&quot;&gt;Bird by Bird&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven’t read that, it’s an amazing book about writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Tiffany Jones Brown at Pinterest introduced me to this book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Down-Bones-Freeing-Edition/dp/1590302613&quot;&gt;Writing Down the Bones&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any interest in Buddhist philosophy, like I do, it’s a very interesting book. But it’s also just a great writing book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more writing book I love is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Several-Short-Sentences-Writing-Vintage/dp/0307279413&quot;&gt;Several Short Sentences About Writing&lt;/a&gt; by Verlyn Klinkenborg  (by a guy’s name I can’t say correctly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always love the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abookapart.com/&quot;&gt;A Book Apart series&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t plug them enough. All of those are great honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a book by Kio Stark called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Go-Back-School-Handbook/dp/0988949008&quot;&gt;Don’t Go Back to School&lt;/a&gt;. So if you want to teach yourself something, anything, that is an amazing book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do yourself a favor and read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nicelysaid.co/&quot;&gt;Nicely Said&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scott Stratten</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/unmarketing&quot;&gt;Scott Stratten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toddhenry.com/&quot;&gt;Todd Henry&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accidentalcreative.com/&quot;&gt;Accidental Creative podcast&lt;/a&gt;. The two rant and discuss how to show empathy in marketing and his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unmarketing.com/about/unbooktour-dates/&quot;&gt;QR Codes Kill Kittens&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accidentalcreative.com/podcasts/ac/ac-podcast-scott-stratten-on-unmarketing/&quot;&gt;full conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unmarketing&quot;&gt;Unmarketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 years ago we formed the company to market the way people wanted to be marketed to. It was created out of, I was just fed up with hypocritical marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody hated getting a cold call. But they wanted to do it better for their own business. And it just hurt my brain. It doesn’t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet at the time was really exploding. And now with the past 5 years with social exploding. It’s a point worth saying that cold calling and “blasting” is almost the lazy man’s way now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is ways of positioning yourself in front of your audience that can be so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;narcissistic-marketing&quot;&gt;Narcissistic Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think narcissistic is actually latin for marketing. Like I really think the translation of the word  - you’re exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what its turned into - look at me. That’s the totally backwards way of thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;poor-marketing&quot;&gt;Poor Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve seen for a number years now, it’s both surprising to me and not, is people are trying to market the same way in every channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they’re taking their old marketing methods, and not old - you can still use them if you’re effective, but they’re taking the commercials, the advertorials they used to put in newspapers and they’re just ramming them down social channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or making YouTube videos of their own stuff. And then asking or incentivizing people to share it versus having them share it out of pure content. And excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the problem where it doesn’t work. It’s why social has been such a failure for so many brands. Because you have people in positions who are paid shotgunners. That’s what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They take the content and they shoot it out. You have some shotgunners. You have some snipers out there, who target who they’re going to shoot it at and then shoot it towards them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But none of them are conversationalists. None of them understand the collaborative conversation that makes social “social”. They get in there and they wonder why they’re getting backlash or no response or no traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-marketing&quot;&gt;Good Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is I love where we’re at now. Because creativity pays. I don’t mean we get paid to write very well anymore or create more. But it pays through content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we create great content it spreads. It takes care of itself now. It used to be you could only get your creative content out there if you had the budget or the contacts. The media may or may not put it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we are the collective audience. And we decide how creativeness spreads. So if you write a really blog post, you don’t have to have an Uncle inside of CNN to help spread it. The audience will. The community will decide that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what I think people are doing right. They’re the ones just dropping off the armor and saying “you know what, this is what I think.” Because to me, when it comes to creativity, when you’re honest, when you’re raw, you polarize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you polarize you attract better and also push some away. You can’t be afraid to do those things. I’ve always said that for me and my day one of UnMarketing. And day one when we launched the UnPodcast. And day one when we launched every single book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not going to hide behind something. This is what I think. This is what I feel. And when people see that it either inspires them to like it or inspires them to hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way they share it. Nothing is artificial in what I do. And nothing should be artificial if you take a stand or you believe or you create in a pure creation way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like the musician who doesn’t have to care about the record label anymore to appease them so they have to sound more “top 40”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like the artist who is painting something doesn’t have to listen to someone say “I want the red to be more red.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can just create for the sake of awesome creation. And that pays off now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I can really see it in a general population sense that creativity truly does pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vulnerable&quot;&gt;Vulnerable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want everybody to like you, nobody does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create something, I don’t care what it is. When you create a bookmark, a TV show, a blog post, a brochure, or video or podcast. Whatever you do. When you put it out there. It’s very raw. It’s part of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re very vulnerable when you put something out there. We don’t talk about this much at all really in business. But when we create and put it out there, we cringe for a second to see what the reaction is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So put out the UnPodcast eight years late to the party. And we put it out there, we hope people like it, and we know we put everything in to it. We have enough confidence to know it’s good content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the first comment on the first episode was a guy who commented, “56 minutes? I haven’t actually listened to it yet. But 56 minutes?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he’s ripping the show before even listening to the show. That was the first piece of feedback we got going into this new world. It’s like launching a new site or new book. It’s a new avenue for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so what happened? We put him on a future episode for saying that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, if I don’t offend at least a person a day - I’m not doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;todd-on-finding-your-own-voice&quot;&gt;Todd on finding your own voice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People want quick success, and they’re in such a hurry to get it, they cannot take time to be true to themselves. This idea that people are so busy imitating other people’s tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They see somebody who is successful so they immediately imitate they’re tactics and try to go for the quick success. But in so doing, they ignore their own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all the things you’re doing when people aren’t looking that actually prepares you for success when people are looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, thanks Todd and Scott.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Valerie Coulton</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiltthewindmill.com/about-me/&quot;&gt;Alistair Croll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coultonv&quot;&gt;Valerie Coulton&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiltthewindmill.com/about/&quot;&gt;Tilt the Windmill&lt;/a&gt;. Valerie is an  Innovation Catalyst at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schibsted.com/&quot;&gt;Schibsted Classified Media&lt;/a&gt;. She tells her story of moving to Barcelona and how her background in customer service has helped lead change in organizations. The excerpt is focused on the first 20 minutes, but hang on for more talk about disruption and lean analytics. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiltthewindmill.com/innovation-culture-and-design-valerie-coulton/&quot;&gt;full audio here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-innovation-catalyst&quot;&gt;What does it mean to be an Innovation Catalyst?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My role over the past year has been starting to bring in new ideas and question a lot about the way that we’re doing things today. And the way we’re thinking about things today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would say that my role is to provoke people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also to bring them some tools, at this point are pretty well proven tools, that help how to cultivate a culture of innovation and how we do innovation that’s going to be meaningful for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-help-people-change&quot;&gt;How do you help people change?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always a question about how far you can provoke people before you cross over into the rogue area. Over the past year, I’ve been trying to bring new ideas in - in a way that would be fairly easy for people to accept. Because I really want us to change the way that we’re working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been trying to find the right ways in with people. Which means putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/&quot;&gt;Design Thinking&lt;/a&gt; into practice and trying to get a lot of empathy with everyone in the company. Trying to understand what their real challenges and problems are - sort of considering them as my users and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get empathy with them, so I know what kind of provocation is going to be appealing to them. And sort of take them on a journey that’s going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I think if I dropped in special agent style with a mission to radically change everything in a day - I don’t think that would of worked very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-you-end-up-in-barcelona&quot;&gt;How did you end up in Barcelona?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m originally from Berkeley and I was living in Oakland. My husband and I thought it would be fun to come to Barcelona for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know just take off from our jobs. We’re both writers in the 
off-hours. We thought it would be so cool to be in Barcelona and be able to travel around Europe and write. And not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after we came here, we thought it would be cool to start working here. So we started teaching and this eventually led to me working for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infojobs.com/&quot;&gt;InfoJobs&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of Schibsted’s sites in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-need-for-innovation&quot;&gt;What do you need for innovation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a Wizard of Oz trinity for innovation. You need a heart, a brain, and courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delighting-customers&quot;&gt;Delighting Customers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a crazy background. I started out in theater. Then I became a small business manager in the Bay area. And I worked in the speciality food industry. Also, coffee and tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve done a lot of small business management and customer service stuff in the past. I was always trying to learn how to delight customers. And how to manage people towards that ideal of servant leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we serve people in a way that is delightful for them and meaningful and rewarding for ourselves. That’s been the through line into everything I’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;servant-leadership&quot;&gt;Servant Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about having service at the heart of what you’re doing. And being able to lead in a way that results in serving others. For me, this has always been a powerful concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I’m leading a team and we have customers or end users - the service I give to the team has to be on the same level of what I’m expecting them to give to our users and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the idea of leading - people, or in a market, or with a product - towards the aim of serving others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found when I worked more directly in customer service - I found this to be a powerful concept. Because I was always working with very bright, young people who usually were at university - going to Cal or other universities in the Bay area - they’re really smart. And they’re having a job in a cafe or what have you, and they’re serving others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For them, it was not always easy to understand that service is a really high profession or high calling. In fact, whenever you’re making something for someone else - ideally you’re trying to get them to this moment of delight or gratitude or appreciation or whatever it is - you’re trying to create for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a question of being a servant. It’s embracing service as a really high human calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea is taking over the world. When I see Airbnb or Uber or TaskRabbit - so many concepts that revolve around a human exchange of people trying to help others or do something for others or trying to create an amazing experience for other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that it’s so transparent now. I’ve got a friend, who is a episcopal minister. And I went to the website of the church of where he’s a minister - they actually had a page where all of his sermons were published. The congregation could go there and they were actually rating each sermon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is amazing. The desire to serve and this offline economy of human interactions is now being facilitated by the online ecosystem, which enables us constantly improve the way that we conceptualize the way we’re serving others or creating great experiences for others or how you ever you want to say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can have so much data about that. We can be constantly improving, constantly getting feedback - to me it’s really fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s all going back to this one simple concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;expectations-for-customers&quot;&gt;Expectations for Customers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact there is a platform now to do more for customers, to do more for users - does make it a necessity. I think all of our expectations are going up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t suggest that every successful business has this warm and fuzzy, hard-felt desire to make people happy. I wouldn’t say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you don’t somehow feel that they take some interest in at least your satisfaction or in your comfort, and if not your delight, then I think they’re in danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say companies that are just transactional, that are at this point just relying on things like efficiency, are probably going to be missing something in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this one is for Alistair - &lt;em&gt;Unless your a ballerina stop pivoting #bumpersticker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Derek Sivers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bob-baker.com/&quot;&gt;Bob Baker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sivers.org/&quot;&gt;Derek Sivers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/creative-entrepreneur-podcast/id721321813?mt=2&quot;&gt;The Creative Entrepreneur podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Derek shares his background from circus ringleader to musician to million-dollar business owner at CD Baby to creating a book publishing company. You can learn a lot from his perspective and his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://sivers.org/a&quot;&gt;Anything You Want&lt;/a&gt;. Check out an excerpt below and watch or listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB-lXs4dEOE&quot;&gt;full conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-your-operating-system&quot;&gt;Changing Your Operating System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a total Chicago boy. Honestly, I didn’t have any interest in the rest of the world, even just seven years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was living in LA at the time and I remember my girlfriend wanted to travel, and I was like - why would we go anywhere else? We live in LA. This is like the end of the rainbow. The best place in the world. What are we going to do? Go to a different beach? You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was somewhere around that time, I was selling CD Baby. I think all of us have a time in our life, where you need to make a major change. Whether it’s a divorce, or a graduation, or a problem with alcohol or whatever. We all hit these different times in our life, where it’s like I need to make a major change now. I can’t just keep doing things the same way I’ve been doing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I sold CD Baby, it was kind of like that to me. I could just keep go doing this some more, but I feel like I need to make a major change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few years, it was everything I’m used to doing - I’m going to stop doing. And everything I used to hate doing - I’m going to start doing. I’m just going to say yes where I used to say no. And no where I used to say yes. And just see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just sent me all over the world. Sent me off to Iceland and India. And moving to Singapore and getting married. All this crazy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a crazy five years, intentionally. Because like I said I kind of wanted to change my operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-were-responsible-for-your-success&quot;&gt;3 Things that Were Responsible for Your Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one has to be being in a big city. When I look back, it’s surprising how many of the great opportunities were because I was in the big city where everything was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in New York City for 10 years and LA for six years. And in both of those, some huge opportunities came up because I was there. So that’s number one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re there, meet everyone. And go to everything. Keep in touch with everyone you meet. The people you meet are going to be the ones that lift you up to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we think success is all of our own doing, but usually the way it happens is metaphorically speaking somebody lifts you up. Somebody pulls you up to the next level of your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to everything. Keep in touch with everyone. But number one, be in the big city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number two - learn to do lots of things. Let’s say musically. That means not just playing guitar. That means playing guitar, and bass, and some keyboards, and able to do some percussion, and able to write well. And play electric and acoustic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That also means having a home studio. And knowing the very basics of recording, engineering, and producing. The more you know how to do the more you can say yes to every opportunity that may come your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number three is I would just say yes to everything. Like I would just pursue every opportunity. You go through all the little Craigslist classifieds and everybody is looking for something, and you contact all of them and say yes. I’ll do it and I’ll audition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You take every gig. And you say yes to it. One time, somebody asked “we’re looking for a jazz piano player.” I told them I was jazz piano player, and said “how much does it pay?” 300. Yes, I’m a jazz piano player and I got the gig. And then I learned how to play jazz piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the hustler mentality. You’ve got to say yes to everything and pursue everything. And actively go and find every opportunity. Don’t just go and sit at home thinking here’s my path I’m just going to get a record deal and be a rockstar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to do everything around it. And meet everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-book-that-changed-your-life&quot;&gt;One Book that Changed Your Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034&quot;&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/a&gt; by Dale Carnegie. It’s got one of the worst, slimiest titles ever.  The title is really a shame. Don’t let the title of the book turn you off. I think it really should of been called - &lt;em&gt;How to be Considerate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it really is the best book I’ve ever seen about how to think about things from the other person’s point of view. That’s what the whole book is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s written back in the 1930s. It’s a classic. And I think that’s really the underlying thing behind all of the best marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s thinking things from the other person’s point of view. It’s thinking how to be considerate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody wants to find some new music - what are they thinking when they’re looking for new music? Are they thinking about your introspective lyrics or your great drum fills? Or are they thinking about having some shockingly unique sound that doesn’t sound like anything they’ve heard before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s learning to think of things from the other person’s point of view. How to Win Friends and Influence People - that book is my top recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say something that’s not just for me, but for everyone. I think we all have different reasons why we do things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently driving around New York City and there are all these buildings that say Trump on them. The Trump Tower, the Trump Plaza, the Trump this, the Trump that. And then I even, my wife and I were driving upstate New York, and we were driving an hour outside of New York City - rural, green upstate New York. And then you see something like the Trump something park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He puts his name on everything. Even out here where they’re aren’t a bunch of Manhattanites to look at it. What’s his deal? Why does he want to put his name on everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that we all have different reasons why we’re doing what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For him apparently, for Donald Trump, he seems to really want to leave this legacy of putting his name on everything. That matters to him because he could actually make more money if he let other people put their names on things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he was an owner, but he got to call the it the Panasonic building or whatever. He could make more money that way. But he actually chooses to make less money, but have his name on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it makes me think about being in the music business or being in Hollywood. The richest people in Hollywood are the ones that you’ve never heard of. They’re the movie producers that live in that mansion on the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the movie stars are often not the richest. They’re the ones that take the red carpet and the flashing lights and the glamour and all that. They makes less money because they want the glamour. They can make more money if they didn’t want the fame. But no, they want the fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they choose fame. And the guy on the hill that you’ve never heard of chooses money and no fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump chooses to put his name on things. Some people choose to give - giving it what they love most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real point is no matter what drives you - someone is going to tell you that you’re wrong. They’re going to tell you that you shouldn’t be like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You shouldn’t purse fame man, you can make more money this way.” And then say if you’re somebody who is pursuing money, somebody is going to tell you - “oh you’re all about the money man, it’s got to be about the art.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is to just be honest about whatever drives you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to notice this about yourself - what interests you the most. And just go for it and admit it. If you’re interested in fame, and want to be famous, then that’s awesome. It’s a totally worthy pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so is being rich or giving or whatever. All of these things - don’t worry, somebody is going to tell you that you’re wrong no matter what is your main drive. And just know that in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-drives-you&quot;&gt;What drives you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m driven by experimentation. Two things. And it’s safe to have two things, cause sometimes it’s really the equal. You can’t choose one or the other. It’s the combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That project wise, I’m driven by experimentation. That almost everything I’ve ever done started with the sentence - “let’s see what happens if . . . “ I just want to experiment. I want to try things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also lifestyle wise, I’m totally driven by freedom. Meaning I will choose to have less money, less fame, if it means I get more freedom to go bob around the world and live in Singapore and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freedom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rena Tom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a Pencil vs. Pixel conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;http://renatom.net/&quot;&gt;Rena Tom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pencilvspixel&quot;&gt;Cesar&lt;/a&gt; Contreras. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pencilvspixel.com/about/&quot;&gt;Pencil vs. Pixel&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by Cesar, is a weekly web show that shares insight, advice, and inspiration about creative work. Rena is a consultant and the market editor for Anthology magazine. Plus she is the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://makeshiftsociety.com/&quot;&gt;Makeshift Society&lt;/a&gt;, a clubhouse and creative co-working space in San Francisco and Brooklyn. Check out an excerpt below and listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pencilvspixel.com/040-rena-tom/&quot;&gt;full conversation&lt;/a&gt; as Rena shares her story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-story-behind-makeshift&quot;&gt;The story behind Makeshift&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold &lt;a href=&quot;http://renatom.net/Rare-Device&quot;&gt;Rare Device&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. I was business partners with Lisa Congdon, who is a great artist. And a good friend. She wanted to do her own thing. Her art business was taking off like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I had an 18 month year old, baby, and I was just spending less time at the shop. It had been a really long time for me. Again I don’t do stuff. I don’t focus really well. I don’t work on anything for a really long amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had the store for six or seven years. And that was a long time for me to be doing any one thing. I wanted to do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was going to do what was the most fun - the most fun aspects of having the shop. Which was working with the makers. And helping out the makers. So I started doing a little consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I missed the books. We always had a really good book selection at Rare Device. It was so much fun to get art and design books, to get the catalogs and choose it. What a fun thing to do. I really missed having all those books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’re expensive. Libraries don’t carry them. So initially Makeshift was going to be a a private lending library of art and design books. And I wanted to just have that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started telling all my friends “wouldn’t be cool if I did this? Would you come and be part of my library?” And they said - “can I sit and work there too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it kind of turned into a co-working space. In fact, we have a really great book lending library for the members. But that’s just one chunk of what we ended up doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important. It shows our dedication to the creative community, which I think a lot of co-working spaces tend to focus either on tech or are just more diffused and general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I like interacting with makers and creatives, that’s who we want to serve, so we try and think of programs and resources for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consulting-is-about-understanding-the-other-side&quot;&gt;Consulting is about understanding the other side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of it is I didn’t know what I wanted to do, except I knew I didn’t want to work for anybody else. So consulting kind of happens because of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did want to see where things would go after I sold the store. So I just started a website and a blog. I just started writing about business stuff. Whatever was in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I kind of put my shingle out there and said, “well if anyone else needs direct help - here I am.” I started to get people responding to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one of my roles in this community is kind of a connector in general. Because if you have a shop, and you’re concerned with the lives of makers and small business people -  you just know everybody. So I knew a lot of folks. It’s fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to be able to talk to everybody and help them out. Try and suggest other people, other resources for them. And give them some advice from someone, who in the case of retail, has been on both sides of the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who has gone through the pains of manufacturing something and selling it. And the other side, someone who wants to buy good product for their store and can’t buy from everybody that sends them an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t take things personally. That’s a big lesson for everybody. You’re rejecting me. No, we’re not really rejecting you. I don’t have any money to spend on your cool product. There’s so many reasons, but not everyone is going to talk to each other about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think a lot of what I do in my role as a consultant is getting them to understand the other side. Which eases communication, which makes it much more likely that you’re going to connect with someone and actually have that buyer relationship at some point down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;steps-to-starting-a-business&quot;&gt;Steps to Starting a Business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of research. I tend to do a lot of research first. And most of the people I know end up being really successful through the research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though at a certain point they have to just jump in. Everyone has a different learning style. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are like “well I’m just going to make that decision and I’m going to go for it.” Good. And then they’ll learn after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll learn while something is on fire, how to put that fire out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’re cool with that. Other people are terrified by that. And they have to have their manual and their binder beforehand. But then you kind of have to shove them out the door. Because you look at their work and you say “this is great, is it selling well?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, I haven’t really told anybody yet.” No, you’re doing it perfectly. Have confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s seeing where people are and trying to reign them in a little bit. Like saying “you might want to get your business permits.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or saying, “no, really tell people - like send out an email or do something to let people know your around. Don’t be afraid. You’re never going to have it perfect. Just get it out there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think knowing what style you are is pretty important. And seeing if you can find either a consultant or mentor or somebody who has done some aspect of business before to talk to. Maybe not all aspects, but something that makes you feel really confident about what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advice-on-getting-started&quot;&gt;Advice on getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard for me to talk because I’m not good at narrowing down what I do. I’ve always got my fingers in way too many pies. And I know that about myself. I’m trying to get better at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think when I go into a new business, which is pretty often, I give myself a time limit. I’m going to have this much success or this many clients or whatever in six or 12 months. I’ll give myself that much space to screw up or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t happen, I’m pretty good at chopping stuff off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think some people say, “well if I can give it three more months, we’re almost there.” But if you can be really realistic about that and set a time limit of like “well, I have many other ideas and set a time limit if it doesn’t happen in this amount of time,” - I’ll still have some time and money leftover to start that second idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And kind of go for it. I think that’s my advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-on-things-that-will-last&quot;&gt;Working on Things that will last&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like things that last. I think what helps me eliminate the more stupid ideas or keeps me from doing all the stupid ideas, because I have a lot of stupid ideas, is there any chance that this will be a lasting thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in San Francisco. And we’re surrounded by people with crazy ideas. People are in a way encouraged just to pursue a crazy idea until it burns out. And then if they fail, pick up and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s good and bad. Because you don’t discriminate as much as maybe you could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if an idea is really super outlandish, I probably won’t go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to do something that will be around. So even if with Rare Device, it’s a store. Sure, it’s just a store. But next year it will be 10. And for brick and mortar that’s pretty damn good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not responsible for the last three years of that, but I’m really proud of it. I’m proud that we’ve built something that hasn’t just gone away or been gobbled up by somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s awesome. It’s just something that feels super good to be there for people for that long. And I’ve met people who’ve shopped at my shop in New York. I run into them on the street there and in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-piece-of-advice-to-an-aspiring-business-owner&quot;&gt;One piece of advice to an aspiring business owner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay focused on what you really want out of something. And just do the damn work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people get stuck in there heads. They want to make things perfect. They want to get things done a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you really just have to work it and make it happen. And put it out there or you won’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t sit on a lot of ideas. I just do them. Just get them out the door. Some of them suck. And some of them work out really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can sleep at night because of that. I don’t regret anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the hard work. There are no shortcuts. Get it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People fail everyday at something, but they also succeed at something every day. To remind yourself about that is a really good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agreed, Rena.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Brad Frost</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is a TEDx talk with Brad Frost. The web designer, writer, and speaker delivers a perspective about  why you should share what you create across the web. You should check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/&quot;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/death-to-bullshit-at-creative-mornings/&quot;&gt;Death to Bullshit&lt;/a&gt; talk about craft. Check out the full &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rW9vTrN6OU&quot;&gt;TEDx video here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-web-changed-creation&quot;&gt;How the Web Changed Creation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it was so expensive to create, the focus was always on the final product. We only printed the good stuff. We only broadcasted or printed the final thing, leaving a vail of mystery around the process that led up to the final work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helped perpetuate this notion that only certain kinds of people can create things. And only certain kinds of things can be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then came the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s totally, radically transformed every aspect of our society, including the nature of our creative process. The bi-directional nature of the web has given us new meaning and new answers to those questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why we create? How we create? Who can create? And what can be created in the process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-the-web-successful&quot;&gt;What Makes the Web Successful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the web is ubiquitous. The web is meant for everyone regardless of race, religion, color, creed, geography, mobile carrier. The web is meant for everyone. That’s far and away its biggest super power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s royalty free. It’s de-centralized. You don’t need to ask permission to publish a website. You don’t need to ask permission to link to another website. That’s an insanely powerful concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s built on open-standards and collaboration. Openness and big, messy collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s in this collaborative world everyday where I like to immerse myself as a web designer. As the web’s evolved, the tools have evolved. We have tools like Wordpress, Medium, and Tumblr that make it dirt simple for anyone to publish their thoughts and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our communication channels have gotten better. To email, to forums, and now Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tools for collaboration have gotten a lot better as well. The magic of Google Documents. Multiple authors working on the exact same document at the same time. That’s magic. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where in the programming world, tools like Git that allow multiple developers to work on the same piece of software without worrying about stepping on each others toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this enables is a developer sitting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and a developer sitting in Japan being able to collaborate on a project together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that’s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking it a step further, we have tools like Github. Which makes it insanely easy for anyone to open source their code or open source their work for other people to use, to fix, to enhance, or to extend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this just a tremendously powerful concept all brought about by the open nature of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chriscoyier&quot;&gt;Chris Coyier&lt;/a&gt; has a website called &lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/&quot;&gt;CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt; where he shares web design articles, tutorials, and resources. And on his site, he has a license which he calls his “super important legal document.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/license/&quot;&gt;the license&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sharing-what-works&quot;&gt;Sharing What Works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get terribly excited when I start to hear about this open mentality start to pour out into other aspects of society and other industries. But I still feel like we have a really long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently talking to somebody that works at a giant hospital that does a lot of cancer research. And they were telling me that their donation form that allows people donate money to cancer research - they bumped up the font size of their donation form. By doing that they increased their donations by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was like “wow, that’s incredible. That’s amazing. Did you share that? That’s amazing insightful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said “well, I’d like to, but they said we’re not allowed to because we’d lose our competitive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitive advantage? Curing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell is wrong with us. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we need more examples of things being done openly, more information being shared by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-share&quot;&gt;Why Share?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody that makes something - you know what an uncomfortable idea it is to share some of your work before it’s finished. It’s a really uncomfortable concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also just incurs a lot of extra work. But it has tremendous advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, it forces you to articulate and justify the decisions that you make. But two, you’re not just sharing with your client, you’re not just sharing in your own little world, you’re sharing with the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that community can provide really sound advice. It can validate and invalidate your decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking that a step further in the web world. People can fix my stuff. And that’s incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve found is that in a lot of cases, it’s actually easier for me to try to solve everyone’s problem rather than just my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-exhaust-to-creative-exhaust&quot;&gt;Data Exhaust to Creative Exhaust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What data exhaust is sort of the by-product of our online activity. Every day we go online and we check out email, opening new tabs, clicking on things, completing tasks and all the while we’re leaving behind this giant wake of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that data has value. That’s the data that big companies like Google, Facebook, and apparently even our government, are using to target ads at us and keep tabs on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this idea that the by-product of our data has value, can be related to our creative processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative exhaust can have value. These by-products of the actual work itself can, in some cases, end up being more powerful than the work you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunity-to-share-what-you-know&quot;&gt;Opportunity to Share What You Know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we have a massive opportunity here to not just share our final works, but using tools like Dribble that allow graphic designers to share their works in progress with the world and get valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like Instagram, which my buddy Tom uses here in Pittsburgh. He builds classic cars. And everyday he has hundreds of people flipping out over the quality of his welds. It’s sort of bizarre to witness from afar, but it’s amazing. He’s share his process and inspiring other people that share his craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share blog posts about our techniques and processes. Share case studies about our successes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make video tutorials. You can knit a hat. But what if you could inspire hundreds of other people to knit many more hats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving things away for free - our design materials. Publishing our code on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you made a kick-ass meal for your family last night. There is the opportunity now to inspire other people to use that same recipe to make their own families happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not about what you do, it’s about what you enable other people to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is an incredibly powerful idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s better? Increasing donations to your site by 20 percent? Or figuring out a way for every non-profit to increase donations by 20 percent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;has-the-internet-been-a-good-thing-or-bad-thing&quot;&gt;Has the Internet been a good thing or bad thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Pew Research conducted a study as the web turns 25. And asked a very simple question - has the Internet been a good thing or bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmingly, over 90 percent of people were like yeah the Internet has been a great thing. I would personally love to meet the 6 percent of people that said the Internet is a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having access to some of all human intelligence in my pocket at my finger tips sucks. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is this amazing tool that helps facilitates the very things that society needs in order to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Openness. Communication. Collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself extremely fortunate to be part of the medium that makes those things happen. I personally can’t think of a better problem to have to help sort out what the web is, where it can go, who it can reach, how it gets used, and why it matters so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pieces-of-advice&quot;&gt;3 Pieces of Advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work hard. Don’t be an asshole. Share what you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you, Brad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maria Popova</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a conversation from the Employee of the Month podcast. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/catielazarus&quot;&gt;Catie Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; and Maria Popova talk through life and learning. Popova curates an amazing blog called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainpickings.org/&quot;&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt; and runs a discovery engine called &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.noodle.org/&quot;&gt;Explore&lt;/a&gt;. It’s impossible not to find inspiration in her work and this talk. Listen to the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/employeeofthemonthshow/popova-maria&quot;&gt;45 minute conversation here&lt;/a&gt; and check out excerpts below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-brain-pickings-start&quot;&gt;How did Brain Pickings Start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do always has two components. And they are always sequential like that. Learning. And then teaching. Or learning and sharing the process of that learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is always about perpetual learning. It actually all began in the confines of the liberal arts institution that I went to and felt let down by academically and intellectually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it just became the record of what I wanted to learn about. It has commonality with the liberal arts. I guess it has the freedom of subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-you-worried-you-wont-own-what-you-create&quot;&gt;Are you worried you won’t own what you create?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, what I do is still for an audience of one. It’s still for me. And what I retain is in my head is enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s lovely that all of these people have sort of tagged along. It’s heartening to hear from someone that they never were into science, but now they’re reading Carl Sagan. That’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what stays with me is what I’ve absorbed and the dots that I’ve connected. And my understanding, as cheesy as it sounds, that’s what it all comes down to - the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we here? What matters? And why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that no one can take away. Of course in very petty and practical terms, Brain Pickings was included in the library of Congress archive of culturally meaningful material - whatever that means. So they’re recording something, I have no idea, on what and how it lives. But it’s somehow being archived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fear&quot;&gt;Fear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest fear, as humans, is that we don’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that people do from creating a magnificent piece of art to having a child to even in some very warped and distorted way, a terrorist performing an act of terrorism  - all of these things are some form of grasping to wanting to matter or change the world to your liking or to a way in which your existence impacts it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And having those touchstones, as you call it, are little reminders that we exist. And that we matter. We’re not just the frivolous stroke of some creator or a bunch of atoms that dissolve one day and go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-you-build-brain-pickings-into-a-business&quot;&gt;How did you build Brain Pickings into a business?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business part has always been a by-product. I’ve been doing this for 7 years. The first 5 years I was flat-broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved to New York in 2010, I could not afford the security deposit to my apartment. I was $80 short after I took all of my savings out of my savings account. I went to an ATM took $80 out and put it back in my checking account to give to my landlord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how broke I was. And on top of that, I have a student loan, credit card debt - the usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t at that point think of Brain Pickings as a business at all. I never did. And I still don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some decisions I made in the beginning - like not to have advertising. I never wanted to have that. I think there is a lot of distortion between public knowledge and information when there is a 3rd party organization involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of reason why Brain Pickings can be what it is and have financial stability now, is it’s all relationships. And I don’t mean networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s people that years ago that I reached out and said I love what you do and I want to support it. I can’t do it financially now, but maybe we can have something that cross-pollinates audiences. Similar people reached out to me in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just sort of mind-melding. You find your people. You find your tribe. And you find sort of this implicit guild of sensibility and idealism, whatever you want to call it. And that’s powerful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s so off-putting when we refer to writing as content. What are we filling with this content. It’s garbage bins - fill it with the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really about shaping the container in the mind that contains it. That’s what it should be about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content is the commodification of knowledge and information and point of view that is just disgusting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as curation goes, we’ve deviated so far from the original concept of it. From an artistic museum standpoint, a curator used to be someone that puts together a show that has a point of view that consists of these different pieces that are strung together by a narrative. And by a framework of sense making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now everybody with an Instagram feed is a curator of life. And granted there are some fantastic Instagram feeds that are curatorial in nature. That there is a consistent narrative and sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By in large, we apply to aggregation and all of these ways of handling content. That to me, is so frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-content-is-off-putting&quot;&gt;Why Content is Off-Putting?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental reason it’s like this is because advertising is still the currency in which media is funded. So a lot of what people call content is really that. A vehicle to advertising. It doesn’t really matter what the substance is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s monetizable because it’s filling pages or drawing click throughs. It’s the same with air time, you have to have something to sell advertising against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think that is not in the public interest. Commercial media today are not in the public interest. They’re in the commercial interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of things like public radio, for as long as it’s existed, have been funded through patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain Pickings is similar to a library, it’s funded by people who find value in it. And it’s optionally so. So it’s not every time the page loads they are forced to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that is essentially what is happening with traditional ad-supported media. Every time you load a page, you pay. You pay with you being there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what’s being sold. No matter what is on that page - you’re paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for making Brain Pickings different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Clayton Christensen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a short excerpt from a conversation between Clayton Christensen and Tom Ashbrook on the On Point NPR radio show. Christensen is the co-author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/How-Will-Measure-Your-Life/dp/0062102419&quot;&gt;How to Measure Your Life&lt;/a&gt;, a book that uses business and real-life examples to teach you lessons. Sandwiched between religious and political sidebars, there is thought-provoking conversation as Christensen answers questions from the audience. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onpoint.wbur.org/2012/05/22/clay-christensen&quot;&gt;full conversation&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-you-spend-your-resources&quot;&gt;Where You Spend Your Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota didn’t come to America with the Lexus. Rather they came into the bottom of the market with a rusty little compact called a Corona. They went from Corona to Tercel, Camry, Avalon, Four Runner, Sequioa, and then a Lexus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Motors and Ford would look at Toyota coming at them from the bottom, and they weren’t asleep at the switch, but they would look at profitability of a crummy little sub-compact or profitability of making bigger SUVs or trucks for bigger people. And it just didn’t make any sense then to defend the least profitable part of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never did the president or board of General Motors agree to get together and develop a plan to run this corporation off a cliff. They never intended to do it. But that’s actually what they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason was on a individual basis - what product should we invest in? What product should we not invest in? What product should we advertise? What product should we not advertise? Incremental decisions at the time made consummate sense, added up to what they didn’t what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that we have the very same situation. Just as General Motors had to decide which of all these products that they’re making should they invest in and which they should not invest in - in our personal lives we have multiple business units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our careers. We have our children. We have our spouses. We have our commitment to our churches sometimes. Our commitment to our communities. And we have to decide which of all these things should we invest in. Invest meaning of of energy, of our time, and our talents. And which will we put off until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have a very high need for achievement - and that includes nearly almost all of this - when we have an extra ounce of energy or 30 minutes to time, we will instinctively invest our resources into whatever activity yields us the most immediate evidence that we’ve achieved something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our careers provide that evidence. I finish a sale. I ship a product. I complete a presentation. I finish teaching a course. I get promoted. I get paid. Our careers provide very tangible immediate evidence of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast when we spend our time and energy with our children, on a day-to-day basis they just keep misbehaving. And it’s really not for 20 years, you can step back and put your hands on your hips and say “we raised a great young man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it pays off only in the long-term. We have a tendency in our minds to invest in those things that give us the most immediate evidence of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why corporations have this propensity to invest in the short rather than the long term, is that they are run by people like you and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deciding-to-be-happy&quot;&gt;Deciding to be Happy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other co-author, Karen Dillon, was the executive editor of the Harvard Business Review. She edited the article I wrote before we wrote this book. And she decided that she needed to quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason was when she added up how she was living her life on a day-to-day basis, it didn’t sum up to the life she wanted to live. So she quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she realized her children met a lot more to her than how she spent her time. You should talk to her, she’s just happy in ways she never imagined before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what you have to decide. If this is the type of person I want to become, and this is the relationships with my family that I want to have, and I’m not investing to do that - then what is life for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because your strategy isn’t what you say it’s going to be, rather your strategy is what you’re spending your time in on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found is that the world is actually very accommodating to invest in a life that we want to have. For example, when I first got out of school, I worked for a big consulting firm in Boston where you spent 70-90 hours every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I been there about a month and my project manager came to me and said Clay we have a meeting Sunday at 2 p.m. Because we had a big meeting with the client the next day. I said Mike, oh my gosh, I can’t come on Sunday because I committed to God. That’s my Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he was just so mad at me. He talked to the team and said we’ll meet Saturday at 2 p.m. I said oh my gosh Mike, I’m sorry but I committed to my wife that I wouldn’t work on Saturday. That’s the day for my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike was even madder at me and he walked away. He came back and said, Clay do you happen to work on Friday? And it turned out that never again for the 5 years I was working with the firm did anyone ever ask me to work on Saturday or Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everyone thinks their situation is unique and difficult. My experience, of course my own might be different, it might be harder - but I’ve certainly spent a lot of time with a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of times what we say we cannot do is actually something that we can do. We just have to tell people that this is not the reason that I’m living my life. This is my purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I can’t be that kind of a person working in this company, I don’t want to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-who-you-want-to-become&quot;&gt;Choosing Who You Want to Become&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We each individually need to decide what kind of person that we want to become. To get to that point, I don’t think it’s inconsistent for me to say - what are the characteristics of Clay Christensen do I want to find myself having accumulated or built over the course of my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will cause other people to say - he was a honest man. He was a selfless man. He gave whatever he had to help other people be better people. That’s not what other people what me to look like. I want to figure out what kind of person I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And having those characteristics or adjectives about Clay Christensen is the kind of person I want to become. I don’t think it’s unwise to think about what kind of impact I have on other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s wisdom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ashley Verrill</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This excerpt is a little off the beaten path. But if you’ve ever received bad customer service or if you work in customer service, you will find it useful. It’s a conversation between Ashley Verrill and Chase Clemons  on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://supportops.co/podcast/&quot;&gt;Support Ops Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashley is a managing editor at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softwareadvice.com/&quot;&gt;Software Advice&lt;/a&gt; where she runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://csi.softwareadvice.com/&quot;&gt;Customer Service Investigator&lt;/a&gt;. Her work has been featured across &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/how-apple-gets-at-home-workers-to-work/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gigaom.com/2013/05/26/how-can-we-provide-better-customer-service-create-software-that-lets-customers-serve-each-other/&quot;&gt;Gigaom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://insights.wired.com/profiles/blogs/how-to-find-the-best-social-app-for-your-business-in-60-seconds?xg_source=activity#axzz33o2kljRq&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://supportops.co/episode-28-investigating-customer-service-with-ashley-verrill/&quot;&gt;full podcast here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-people-expect-transparency-today&quot;&gt;Why People Expect Transparency Today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it stems from a generational change. This new generation is so used to sharing everything. By default they assume that companies should return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your definitely seeing the desire starting with the customer. With a lack of information, people assume that there is something that you are hiding. So that is another contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is playing a huge role in this shift. Because if customers do feel like they are not getting the information that they want or not even hearing the answer that they want, they’ll head straight to social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a big risk for companies, where I think maybe even a couple years ago companies might still say people are not really do that. It’s still new. And it’s not something we really have to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re really seeing increasing attention by companies around really getting these support channels moving - and managing them proactively. So that they can mitigate some of these potentially negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you think about it - social media is just a means for really spreading a negative message further and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-proving-on-video-support---amazon-maydayhttpwwwamazoncomgphelpcustomerdisplayhtmlnodeid201349900&quot;&gt;On Proving on Video Support - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201349900&quot;&gt;Amazon MayDay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, it’s not a new technology. There have been companies doing this for a long time. It’s just receiving attention recently with Amazon taking this on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it could be the future of tech support. Or it could be a terrible misstep that Amazon loathes themselves for even trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one - it addresses two common things customers get frustrated with more traditional channels. One being having to play around in a phone tree and having to navigate through your system and have to talk to five different agents and listen to hold music. And all these things people really hate about traditional phone support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two - it helps reduce the time to resolution. The video support model, or at least the way Amazon using it, has the customer already logged in their account and they are accessing the agent on the device that is most likely having the issue. The agent has immediate context into the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t have to walkthrough the whole can I have your account number, tell me what’s going on, all those sorts of things. So it speeds time to resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’re in a society of instant gratification. I want the answer now. And I want the problem solved now. From that point it could be the future of support because it can increase customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the risk end of things, it’s also a very labor intensive channel. With things like chat and email, you have this asynchronous support happening where you can help more than one customer at once. In the interest of productivity and efficiency that is really appealing for companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you’re on a video screen, you have to give your undivided attention to that customer. And you have to have agents that are “camera ready”. They have to be in a sterile environment. They can’t have a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fvolcanicensemble.blogspot.com%2F2013%2F05%2F10-fictional-restaurants-i-fantasize.html&amp;amp;h=0&amp;amp;w=0&amp;amp;tbnid=Q-N_Tr1DOx278M&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;tbnh=194&amp;amp;tbnw=240&amp;amp;docid=FRBLvX0WGUI7-M&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;ei=IuuQU-3WB8yXyAT22oDYAw&amp;amp;ved=0CAsQsCUoAw&quot;&gt;chotskies&lt;/a&gt; all over their desk. They need to have video. They need to have a microphone. They need to be trained in a different way. Because you can see every facial expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-amazon-is-using-video-support&quot;&gt;Why Amazon is Using Video Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about providing better support. This is one of the reasons Amazon is using it. You gave a really good example of your friend that wanted advice on what book to read - that’s exactly what Amazon wants you to use it for. Because really the idea is that this channel will help them sell more. Or sell to you better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more traditional support channels, it can be cumbersome to pick up the phone and call every time you have a problem. A lot of times customers just won’t do anything. So you aren’t able to capture any of the data of where customers are actually running into problems. And where in the customer lifecycle they are happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But putting this channel in the context of where it actually occurs and making it so easy to use, Amazon is increasing their likelihood that customers will reach out and say something about it. Even if the interface wasn’t as intuitive and they couldn’t figure it out, that’s a piece of data Amazon can use to go improve their support for future customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-service-support&quot;&gt;Self Service Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support homepage for customers today is Google. Less and less they are navigating to your homepage. And then from there navigating to your support pages. Often, they just go ahead and type the question right into Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have the content there from them to find, the more they have to dig for it - the more frustrated their going to get. So imagine if they finally get to the phone and they’ve been digging around for 30 minutes or trying to find an answer in a discussion thread, and there just not finding it - their level of frustration is compounding the more time that passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the biggest reasons it’s so important for companies to focus on self service. It’s measuring the quality of that content the same way they measure the quality of the service over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies really do not do a whole lot of measuring of self service to see what’s working and what’s not working. If a customer clicks through to five different pages, and still doesn’t find what they are looking for - it’s probably a signal you need to create a new article for your self-service channel. It’s crucial to making these channels useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a way to create real brand advocates. Self service communities that enable things like gamification where you’re really getting your customers engaged with your brand. Not only are you deflecting tickets from your call center because customers are able to help themselves. And that’s a cost benefit obviously. Your also turning them into a brand advocate along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing on the marketing side of things is you can’t just run advertisements anymore. Word of mouth marketing is becoming increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What better way to get your customers talking positively about your brand then to give them this community platform where you show them just how important they are. And you arm them with the tools to help other customers, really show them off as being valued parts of your company. Not just customers. You’re part of what makes this company great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone channel could be called the channel of the future it’s self-service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jason Fried</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from Chicago Founders’ Stories. Jason Fried shares the the story behind 37 Signals, Basecamp, and working with Jeff Bezos. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PatRyanChicago&quot;&gt;Pat Ryan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.builtinchicago.org/&quot;&gt;builtinchicago.org&lt;/a&gt;. Watch the entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/88749951&quot;&gt;interview here&lt;/a&gt;. The transcript starts at 1:18:30.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love listening to him, more than talking to him. I will give you one business thing and one life thing he told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;business&quot;&gt;Business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing in business is to figure out what’s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; going to change in your business. And invest heavily in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of businesses are focused on what’s changing. Change. Change. Change. But he says you should do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gave me an example of Amazon. 10 years from now, people are not going to wake up and say I wish Amazon’s selection was worse. Right. So they are going to appreciate a big selection now, and forever. Invest in big selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are not going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Amazon’s shipping was slower. So they can invest in Amazon’s shipping now and it will always pay off forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are not going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Amazon’s customer service was crappier. So let’s invest in customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find those things that are never going to change. And pour everything you have into those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, people are not going to wake up 10 years from now and I say I wish Basecamp was slower. So we’ve invested heavily in performance and speed. Our app is very, very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are not going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Basecamp’s customer service was crap. We’ve been investing heavily in that. Right now, if you email Basecamp support - you will get a response in under 2 minutes. Some days under a minute. And that’s unheard of in email response. We’ve invested heavily in that. Because that is a great experience and people aren’t used to that. It’s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People aren’t going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Basecamp was hard to use. So we have to invest in making it simpler. A lot of people want more stuff. That’s a trick. But fundamentally people aren’t going to want to make things harder to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are the places we invest. And I believe in that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life&quot;&gt;Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About life, he said you don’t find your passions. Your passions find you. So when I ask him, why are you into space? He says, I don’t know space found me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask him why are you into a 10,000 year clock? And he says, I don’t know that concept found me. He’s really big into that. If you don’t really know what you’re passionate about yet - don’t search for it. It will find you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I thought that was a really cool piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tina Roth Eisenberg</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from a 2-part series on mentor lessons with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swiss-miss.com/about/hi-i-am-tina&quot;&gt;Tina Roth Eisenberg&lt;/a&gt;. Tina shares tips to success for Shopify’s 2013 Build a Business Competition. Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopify.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the video. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrhktR0YfCw&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKFsf0PyoTg&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-best-way-to-complain&quot;&gt;The Best Way to Complain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be a complainer, make things better. I have this personal rule that if I find myself complaining about this same thing over and over again, I need to either let it go or do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you look at my side projects that turned into companies, they are all based out of that rule. I started a temporary tattoo business, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tattly.com/&quot;&gt;[Tattly]&lt;/a&gt;, because I couldn’t stand my daughter’s temporary tattoos that she would bring home from birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a to-do app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teuxdeux.com/&quot;&gt;[TeuxDeux]&lt;/a&gt;, because I couldn’t find the one I wanted. I started a co-working space called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.studiomates.com/&quot;&gt;Studiomates&lt;/a&gt; just because I couldn’t find the work environment that I envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I started a a breakfast lecture series, &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativemornings.com/&quot;&gt;[Creative Mornings]&lt;/a&gt;, because I was tired of big, bloated conferences that were too expensive and unaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these things have turned into accidental businesses. So I really believe as James Murphy from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcdsoundsystem.com/main/&quot;&gt;LCD Soundsystem&lt;/a&gt; said - the best way to complain is to make things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is really a lesson I want to teach my children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;numbers&quot;&gt;Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really believe our society has come too dependent on numbers. Numbers are important, I don’t disagree with that. But I do feel we need to be able to listen to our gut a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all the really important decisions in my life, looking back, have been gut decisions. It’s something that I ask my children a lot, what does your gut say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to shift my daughter’s mindset to what is my body telling me. It’s just something I think we need to reconnect again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunity&quot;&gt;Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the opportunity scares you, you need to take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;surround-yourself-with-like-minded-people&quot;&gt;Surround yourself with like minded people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing I want to teach my children, it is that you need to surround yourself with like-minded people. Smart, kind, driven people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more contagious than being around people that are as enthusiastic or interested in similar things than you are. That’s contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I’ve started Studiomates, a co-working space here in Brooklyn. Because I really believe you spend so much time at work. I want to be surrounded by people that I really enjoy being around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced I wouldn’t be where I am right now, if I wasn’t surrounded by my Studiomates. It’s really important you surround yourself with like-minded and kind people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;haters&quot;&gt;Haters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people that build things, and people that tear them down. Ignore haters. They get none of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspire&quot;&gt;Inspire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We owe it to the people around us to inspire others. Because when you’re happy, when you’re on the right track, when you’re doing something that is fulfilling you - you are going to be inspiring other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like we all owe it to each other to get to that point where we are happy in our life. And able to pass that enthusiasm, energy, and happiness on by inspiring other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peter Coughter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a conversation between Peter Coughter and Mitch Joel for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistimage.com/podcast/&quot;&gt;Six Pixels of Separation Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Coughter is the author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Pitch-Persuasion-Presentation/dp/0230120512&quot;&gt;The Art of the Pitch&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the VCU Brandcenter, and an advertising consultant. Check out an excerpt below, and listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twistimage.com/podcast/archives/spos-376---better-pitching-principles-with-peter-coughter/&quot;&gt;full talk here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nervous-and-scared&quot;&gt;Nervous and Scared&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning, I was in my car and I was listening to a sports talk show. And we can learn things from all kinds of different places by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees, who is arguably the greatest relief pitcher of all time. And this is a guy who comes in when the game is in the balance, usually trying to protect a very slim lead and there’s usually people on base. There’s a difficult hitter at-bat. And it’s his job to retire the side and preserve the win for his team amidst the greatest form of pressure you can find in that business of baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s done it more times, more successfully, than anybody else. The fellow interviewing him, asked if he was nervous. And this guy has been doing this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he said of course I’m nervous. When I come in from the bullpen and the walk in - I’m really, really nervous. And he’s done this several thousand times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s the same thing with presenting. I think you should be nervous. In fact, Mr. Rivera says that. He said if I wasn’t nervous walking into the mound, I’d be upset with myself. I need to be nervous then. But once the game starts, once they put the ball in my hand, I’m not nervous at all anymore - to be nervous then would be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a lot of parallels in that. It’s certainly the way I try to approach it. It’s natural to be nervous. The best presenters I know are nervous. But once they get going - it goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chemical changes that take place in the body when we’re really excited or when we’re really scared are exactly the same. They’re identical. So let’s choose to go with the excitement side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-not-to-present&quot;&gt;How not to present&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole idea of what people think a presentation is (with big quotes around it) - is completely screwed up now. People lay the foundation of their own failure. Because they follow these conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop talking about this thing as if it was a presentation. Just don’t think about it that way anymore. Just don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t say “and now Peter will talk about . . .” - no, don’t do that. Peter just starts talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re seeing a movie or a play, the guy doesn’t say and now he exits stage left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love when people say, “and this slide you can see and a couple slides later from now.” Shut up with that. Stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other one is a ridiculously awful to read slide comes up - and they say, “I know this is an eye chart and I know you can’t see this, but”. Then why did you put it on the screen, you idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the eye witness news collection of presenting. And the audience thinks what a  bunch of bozos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-the-audience-to-like-you&quot;&gt;How to get the Audience to like you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People seem to think if we tell the audience everything we know about a particular subject, the audience will like us. And they’ll think we’re smart. And neither of which is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we actually give the hour and half presentation in a half  hour, and give a hour of their lives back to them - then they will like us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;telling-stories&quot;&gt;Telling Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how we learn. There is book that’s been for hundreds of years. It’s called the Bible. And all it is - stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no bullet points in there. It’s just stories. There’s not a whole lot of facts. And that book is more successful than any book that has ever been written. It’s what people turn to when they need inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to tell stories. It’s a series of hopefully personal, germane stories that add up to one big narrative arc. That’s tied together by the through line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you do that, it’s magical. It’s just magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it takes is sitting down and thinking about one’s own life. I can’t tell you how many times when I’ve been sitting down with the team and ask what about you - and they’ll say yeah I did something that is absolutely specific to what we’re talking about in the presentation. This is what they weren’t going to include because it wasn’t germane. When in reality it’s the only thing I really want them to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget all that other bullshit. Tell them your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;business-jargon&quot;&gt;Business Jargon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not shoot ourselves in the foot by being so smart that we’re dumb. It annoys me all the time. Business jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much crap. The next person that says to me - “and now I’m going to take a deep dive.” I know I said I wouldn’t drop an f-bomb, but fuck you with your deep dive. Stop it. Get out of here with that crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it human. And simple. That doesn’t mean dumb. It means simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Debbie Millman</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from a conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;http://debbiemillman.com/&quot;&gt;Debbie Millman&lt;/a&gt; and Jonathan Fields for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodlifeproject.com/&quot;&gt;Good Life Project&lt;/a&gt;. Millman shares her career path and wisdom on how to find purpose in your life. Watch and listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwGLx7l1Ybc&quot;&gt;full episode here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-what-you-want&quot;&gt;Do what you want&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I teach seniors in college. And my class is about getting a job. But it’s about getting the job of your dreams. Not just getting a job to pay the rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can actually try to do both right at the get go. And if anything it’s easier right at the get go than rebooting your life at 32, 10 years in. Because you suddenly realize, I’m getting older and if I don’t do what I want at some point soon, I’m likely going to die not doing what I want ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s a lot harder at 32 or 42, than it is at 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;growing-up&quot;&gt;Growing up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept diaries from 1973 to 1992. And I’ve been going through and reading them all. I realized just how low I felt and how hopeless I felt about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s sort of interesting. As you grow as a person or human being, you somehow think you’re still the same person. You’re just bringing all of those same experiences along. Yes, you’ve realized more but your intrinsically the same person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’ve been thinking a lot about that. Now that I’m in my 50s, I feel like I’m still 14. But then when I went back and read my journals at 14 or my diaries, I am definitely not 14. And I’m nothing like that 14 year old person. Nor am I like the 32 or 42 year old person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But going through that is what gives you that clarity. Seeing how far you’ve come, how there isn’t quite as much self loathing, how there isn’t quite as much insecurity - it’s still there, but it’s not the prevailing emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one common denominator that I can share with anyone that is going through self loathing in their 20s, 30s, 40s, or even 50s - is that don’t give up that it might never go away. Because I think it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patience&quot;&gt;Patience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one of the unfortunate aspects of the technologically driven world that we live in is the speed in which people want things to happen. I’ve been joking a lot lately that we’re now living in a 140 character culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we expect things to not only happen instantly, but also be expressible in this sort of very short telegraphic manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was doing a lecture for a group of students several months ago, and I was talking about how long things can take. I feel as though I really didn’t achieve, in this sort of classic achievement model, anything that would be considered successful - really until I was in my 40s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young woman raised her hand at the end of the lecture, and asked for some advice because she had started a blog and she was hoping to get some pointers on how to get people to come to the blog, to read the blog. Because she was feeling very discouraged. She had been doing it for awhile and people weren’t reading it. She wasn’t getting any traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my first question was how long have you been doing it? And very sincerely, very earnestly, she said six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I can’t even come up with an idea in six weeks, let alone a viral blog. This is a really unfortunate ramification is this 140 character culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;success-takes-time&quot;&gt;Success takes time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in there 20s, when they graduate from college, expect that they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be successful. And if they aren’t successful in their 20s or right out of the gate, that there is something wrong with them. And that builds into this real sense of hopelessness because they haven’t achieved something quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I don’t even know if I would want to achieve something in my 20s looking back. Anything significant. Because then you have to maintain it. Then you have to keep doing it over and over. You have to keep hitting the home runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d much rather build to something that could conceivably be sustained just because of the length of time its taken for you to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fulfillment-and-happiness&quot;&gt;Fulfillment and Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I think we run into trouble in being fulfilled. If you think about it, our grandparents didn’t come home at night and talk to their spouses or siblings or whoever about whether or not they were happy at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about how they were going to survive, support their families and themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to make your own happiness wherever you are. Your job isn’t going to make you happy. Your spouse isn’t going to make you happy. The weather isn’t going to make you happy. A restaurant isn’t going to make you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you have to decide what you want and you have to find that way of doing it, whether or not the outside circumstances are going to participate in your success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for people that want to create something meaningful, if you’re not getting it at work then do it at home. If you’re not getting everyday in the workplace, self generate your own work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make what you need to do to be happy. Even if other people think it’s crap. Even if other people think it’s terrible. You have to be able to create your own happiness. Period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-good-life&quot;&gt;What’s a good life?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine immensities. Pick yourself up from rejection and plow ahead. Don’t compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start now. Start now - every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beautiful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ezra Firestone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecommercefuel.com/&quot;&gt;eCommerceFuel&lt;/a&gt; podcast with Andrew Youderian and Ezra Firestone. Ezra shares his unique story from poker player turned entrepreneur, and how to market a product with messaging. Listen to the full &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecommercefuel.com/blending-message-product-ezra-firestone/&quot;&gt;interview here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-what-you-want&quot;&gt;How to get what you want&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe you get what you want from people who have it. If you want to run an eCommerce store, you find someone like you - and you learn it from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had that belief, and held that belief very strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I decided what to do next, college - there is women there and that looks like fun. But I don’t particularly want anything that the teachers are offering. So I’m going to move to New York and sort things out from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was playing poker for a living an underground clubs. When I was 13 or 14 the poker craze was taking over America. It was all over ESPN and they had these online poker rooms that have now been banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was this big thing that was happening, but I had been playing cards since I was a kid. I had a leg up on everyone because I was doing it for so long. I made my living in New York City playing poker at these underground clubs. Guys like Vinny the limosine, Sunny Francheesy, and Frank Bananas, and Pauly 10 Fingers - all of these were part of these underground clubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short that was a degenerate lifestyle. You’re up all night, you sleep all day, you’re under fluorescent lights, there is only a bunch of dudes around -  it was not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking at another way of supporting myself. I ran into a guy that was making his money as a SEO. This was back in 2005. He was basically generating traffic on the search engines to sell an information product, which was home to become a life coach. This was before coaching had really taken off in the states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said, hey man the way you’re doing things is attractive to me. Because you’re working from your laptop. I’d like to learn that. So we made a little deal where I taught him to play poker and he taught me search engine optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I ended taking over his company and sort of cutting my teeth on information marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-need-to-make-a-business-work&quot;&gt;What You Need to Make a Business Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have all these different businesses. And one thing I understood from the beginning was in order to make a business work you need a couple things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need traffic or visibility for whatever it is you’re selling. Be it an information product, a physical product or someone else’s product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then once someone knows your product or service exists you need to get them to say yes or take you up on that. That’s conversion, landing page psychology - so how many people see your stuff and buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you need repeat sales. Once someone has done business with you, you need them to come back and do business with you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found my way to eCommerce because it was really the business model, I had the most control over. I could really ensure that people who were engaging with me and doing business with me had a good experience. I controlled customer service. I controlled the money. I controlled the product funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the business model I felt I could scale the best and be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-about-you-and-your-products&quot;&gt;Not About You and Your Products&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The faceless eCommerce store is dying. And you can no longer just list products and expect to do well in a market. You got to add some form of value beyond products to your marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any good physical product businesses are content marketers. With &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boombycindyjoseph.com/&quot;&gt;BOOM&lt;/a&gt; that’s really what it is. We create content on a regular basis that engages our community to is relevant to the topics, conversations, and lives of that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t talk so much about our products. You think about Lance Armstrong. When all that scandal was happening, all the cycling websites and blogs were talking about that. Because that was relevant to the community. And then in those posts, they would mention some product they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOOM is a skin care product for baby boomer women who are going through menopause or have gone through menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at marketing, fundamentally my opinion is marketing is talking to people about experiences they are having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you have a group of people who are having what I call a collective experience, like baby boomer women in America. Their bodies are aging on the outside faster than they are on the inside and society is treating them differently as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a group of people going through a collective experience. They’re all going through the same thing at the same time. So you can talk to them about that experience and make them offers that are relevant to those experiences and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;messaging-makes-the-difference&quot;&gt;Messaging makes the difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every product, there are similar products. What differentiates what you’re going to be able to sell is your messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with BOOM we have phenomenal messaging in this particular business. Because we know the experience that our group of people is having and we’re taking to them about that. And then we’re brining up our products and we’re using those products as a way to support the conversation that we’re having - rather than using the conversation as a way to sell the products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-selling&quot;&gt;What is Selling?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling is taking the information someone gives you about themselves and making them a relevant offer based on that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It sure is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jessica Hische</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a Creative Mornings talk with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jessicahische.is/awesome&quot;&gt;Jessica Hische&lt;/a&gt; in Vancouver. Hische delivers about a 10 minute rant sans slides that is amazing. The majority of the excerpt is in the beginning, but you hang on for a great conversation about type. Watch and listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/44045435&quot;&gt;full video here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mandatory&quot;&gt;Mandatory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows as soon as you make something mandatory, it becomes the opposite of what you want to do for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to learn a second language forever. And I refuse to learn Spanish even though I live in the middle of the mission in San Francisco. It would honestly help my day to day to learn Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead I say maybe I’ll learn Finnish, maybe I’ll learn German - something completely useless that I won’t use. Because then it’s fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to learn things that aren’t helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-the-tools&quot;&gt;Learn the tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to learn the tools to make awesome stuff. You don’t not learn it just because it seems intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make cool things, you’ve got to learn the tools it takes to make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would really love to punch web designers in the face that refuse to learn how to do HTML and CSS. Because if I’m a letterer and can learn how to do it myself in six months for a thing that is completely unrelated to my career - I just think it’s lazy if you don’t learn it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is going to go live on the internet and a bunch of people are going to rain down shit on me for it. But I really believe that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean if you’re a mechanic, you’re not like - meh, I’ll only learn about this one thing related to cars. And then outsource everything else and make my customers’ life a complete hell. You know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You learn the tools you need to know to make the things you want to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it is completely unrelated to your field. But for me, I wouldn’t be able to do any of the side projects I do if I didn’t learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are your cheapest labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a thing you want to do, don’t be lazy and just say I guess I can’t do it because it will take me three weeks to learn the thing I have to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just grab the reigns and fucking do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;college&quot;&gt;College&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire to learn is really the only thing you should of picked up in college. Your college career or your diploma is not this definitive you have all the knowledge in the world, go out and make shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing they have to instill in you is the thought that learning is fun. That’s the only thing to learn in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That learning doesn’t stop in college. You have to really take joy in learning this new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-things&quot;&gt;Making things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so liberating to be able to make anything you want to make. And it’s not scary. And people try to make it into this super nerdy, scary thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML is just going around with a label maker and throwing labels on everything. And CSS - it’s annoying you have to write all these commas and semicolons, and all this other jazz - but it’s pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can just read through it and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stanley Hainsworth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from a 2010 conversation between Stanley Hainsworth and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Scobleizer&quot;&gt;Robert Scoble&lt;/a&gt;. Hainsworth shares his path to storytelling and his agency &lt;a href=&quot;http://tether.com/&quot;&gt;Tether&lt;/a&gt;. Special thanks to Scoble and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/building43&quot;&gt;Rackspace&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the video. Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejSSLzaJplw&quot;&gt;full conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brands-are-people&quot;&gt;Brands are People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always equate brands as people. You could describe what Apple is as a person. Because of the personality they’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with companies, the first thing I do is say lets figure out what your story is. What sets you apart in the marketplace from anyone else? Yeah, you have a product or service, but what colors that? What are you like as a person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same way with a brand or product. A product needs to have a brand associated with it. If there is a buzz about a new app that came out, people say well who made that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name of that company - what does that stand for now? If that company wants to start creating other products, they need to start creating their story. Then everything they do will link back to that story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;steve-jobs-and-apple&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs and Apple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all part of that brand personality. He’s realized that me, as a person, I want to associate myself with things that complement my story. That help define who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I buy a computer, I want that thing to be beautiful. Inside and out. Backwards and forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He [Steve Jobs] realized that early on. That a phone or computer is actually an accessory to you. It’s an appendage of you. Our phones, iPads, and computers have all become our appendages - part of our personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His attention to detail and the beauty of it, really ties to his story. Some people called it snobbery in the beginning, but it’s a key thing of their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-get-to-being-a-loved-brand&quot;&gt;How do you get to being a loved brand?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to have an authentic story and you have to be true to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start getting away from it, like Nike went through that period. And Starbucks went through that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re very successful, you can slap on swoosh on anything and sell it. Hey, lets sell lunch boxes and school supplies - what does that have to do with being an athlete?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks started getting into that too. How about movies? We start promoting that in our stores? It was like that doesn’t have anything to do with the coffee house experience. Music? Yeah. Books? Yeah. Coffee? Yeah. Movies? That doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer will correct you - by leaving you to go somewhere else. That’s not who I signed up for. That’s not the brand I signed up for - you’re someone else now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-as-a-crutch&quot;&gt;Technology as a Crutch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computers can’t come up with the ideas for us. The technology can’t generate the ideas. I just finished a book about how ideas come to life - it’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Idea-ology-Designers-Journey-Turning-Inspired/dp/1592535976&quot;&gt;Idea-ology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote it because I was disturbed by how people were using technology to get ideas. It seemed like you don’t have to come up with original ideas anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would observe people when given a challenge - the first thing they would do is go on a web browser and start searching for inspiration. What they’re doing is feeding off other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they start flipping through what other people have done on the web. It felt like we’re kind of feeding of each other, kind of cannibalistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one way it’s cool, kind of mashing up a bunch of ideas. But where is your original idea? In the old days, when you couldn’t browse everything to be inspired from it or borrow from it or whatever you want to call it - you had to actually go for a run, walk along the beach, go for a hike, or meditate in your chair and actually come up with something original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what the book is - how do you come up with an original idea, make it yours, bring your life experiences into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brands-read-your-soul&quot;&gt;Brands read your soul&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what great companies do. They’ll read your soul and give you something you don’t even know you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-term-plan&quot;&gt;Long term plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every startup should have their one-year plan, but even more important is there five-year plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you envision yourself five or 10 years from now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the first thing I did when I started Tether. I did a FAQ with myself. I interviewed myself and I shared it with my team here when I started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I see us in five years. Because I interviewed myself five years from now and how our company is. It’s been our business plan, our guiding soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-your-point-across&quot;&gt;Get Your Point Across&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at Starbucks, I noticed the photography wasn’t looking good. It’s because there was like 5 clients with the art director and photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the head of design, I could have gone in and kind of cleansed the temple. And sent everyone out, and said this is our job and we’re doing this. Instead I got everyone together and I showed beautiful photography. And it was right before lunch, it was dripping things and lucious things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone said, wow - could we do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said, oh that’s a good idea. Let me try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went out a did a little test shoot and shot some stuff. 
They said that is so beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said you know how we get this? A photographer is like an artist or film director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said like no one on the set? I said yeah - it’s not a strict facsimile of your product. It’s an emotional interpretation of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From then on, they never came and I never had to tell them not to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found using that method to be very successful in a collaborative environment. Whether it’s a company you own with 10 people or Starbucks with thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ways to treat people. Respect who they are, and what their opinions are, but still get your points across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kathy Sierra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from 2010 Gov 2.0 Expo with Kathy Sierra. She has given this talk several times and spread the message on her &lt;a href=&quot;http://headrush.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/OreillyMedia&quot;&gt;O’Reilly Media&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the video. Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM55NiXSOPs&quot;&gt;full talk here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kicking-ass&quot;&gt;Kicking Ass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there is passion, there are people kicking ass. People don’t sustain passion for things they continue to suck at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that passion is compelling for people is because when they are pursing something, learning and growing - they start to have a higher resolution. They have deeper, richer experiences for the things they are passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the more you learn about a particular style of music - you actually hear more than the rest of us. You hear subtleties. It’s as if the music changed it’s resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;higher-resolution&quot;&gt;Higher Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High resolution means deeper, richer experiences. And that’s the kind of thing we need to create for people or we’re not going to have passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it always exists where there is passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-killer-users&quot;&gt;Create Killer Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this is an obvious thing. But it’s amazing how little we focus on that when we want people to become passionate. Because we are so focused on our role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to make better products. We’re going to make better services. We’re going to deliver better things for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They really don’t care what you do. I’m not passionate about what you do. I’m passionate about what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do. It’s your job to enable that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quit thinking about making a better “x”. Think about making a better user of “x”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I work with authors a lot. This distinction can mean ripping out 200 pages that are designed to make the author look smart. And adding 200 pages that make the actual reader smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As programmers, you’re familiar with the idea of making a killer app. But that’s not what we want to make if we want passion. We need to create a killer user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a different mindset. And it might be a completely different feature set. When you stop thinking about what you’re delivering, and start thinking about what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brilliant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Steve Jobs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from the 1997 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. An hour long Q &amp;amp; A, it includes nuggets of brilliance that still are true 17 years later. Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/mactechlab&quot;&gt;mactechlab&lt;/a&gt; for posting it to YouTube, and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/semil/status/386650847268331520&quot;&gt;Semil&lt;/a&gt; for sharing the video. Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/3LEXae1j6EY&quot;&gt;full talk here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-555httpyoutube3lexae1j6eyt5m55s&quot;&gt;Focus: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/3LEXae1j6EY?t=5m55s&quot;&gt;5:55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about focusing, you think focusing is saying yes. Focusing is about saying no. Focusing is about saying no. You’ve got to say no, no, no. And when you say no, you piss off people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of that focus is really great products. Where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-press-754httpyoutube3lexae1j6eyt7m54s&quot;&gt;The Press: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/3LEXae1j6EY?t=7m54s&quot;&gt;7:54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure a lot of you have had this experience - where you’re changing and growing as a person. And people tend to treat you like you were 18 months ago, and it’s really frustrating sometimes. When you’re growing up and becoming more capable, you’ve had some personality quirks you’ve gotten over - whatever it may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And people still treat you like you were a year or 18 months ago. It can be very frustrating. It’s the same with a company. It’s the same with the press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The press is going to have a lag time. The best thing we can do about the press is to embrace them and educate them about the strategy. But keep our eye on the prize. And that’s putting out great products, communicating with our customers the best we can, getting the community of people who are going to make this stuff successful, like yourselves, in the loop so you know everything. And marching forward one foot in front of the other. The press will take of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;competition-and-perception-2840httpyoutube3lexae1j6eyt28m43s&quot;&gt;Competition and perception: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/3LEXae1j6EY?t=28m43s&quot;&gt;28:40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day we started Apple Computer, IBM was far more powerful in the computer industry than Microsoft and Intel are today. Because they not only controlled the technologies, they controlled the customer. They had direct contact with the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we should of just given up. I should of just nudged Woz, and said forget it. We don’t have a chance. But we were too stupid to know that. We hadn’t gone to business school. We didn’t even know what the Wall Street Journal was, I’d had never even seen a Wall Street Journal. And that served us well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every good product I’ve seen in this industry is because a group of people cared deeply about making something wonderful that they and their friends wanted. You know? They wanted to use it themselves. That’s how the Apple I came about, the Apple II came about, the Macintosh - that’s how everything I know that’s good has come about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t come about because people were trembling in the corner worried about some big company stomping on them. Because if a big company made the product that was right, most of these things wouldn’t of happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Woz and I could of went down and plunked $2,000 bucks and bought an Apple II, why would we have built one? &lt;strong&gt;We weren’t trying to start a company, we were trying to get a computer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way you get programmer productivity is not by increasing the lines of code per programmer per day. That doesn’t work. The way you get programmer productivity is by eliminating the lines of code you have to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marketing-4650httpyoutube3lexae1j6eyt46m50s&quot;&gt;Marketing: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/3LEXae1j6EY?t=46m50s&quot;&gt;46:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing is a subjective thing. It’s not a science. There is a lot of art to it. My personal belief is that the medium really does communicate a lot about the message. In some cases, the medium overrides the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-the-customer-experience-5112httpyoutube3lexae1j6eyt51m12s&quot;&gt;Start with the Customer Experience: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/3LEXae1j6EY?t=51m12s&quot;&gt;51:12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve as found is that you have got to start with the customer experience and work backwards with the technology. You can’t start with the technology and try to figure out where you’re going to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made this mistake probably more than anyone else in this room. And I’ve got the scar tissue to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iphone-10310httpyoutube3lexae1j6eyt1h3m10s&quot;&gt;iPhone: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/3LEXae1j6EY?t=1h3m10s&quot;&gt;1:03:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher order bit for me is connectivity. What I want is this little thing that I carry around with me. It’s got a keyboard on it, because if you do email - you need a keyboard. And you need to be connected to the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if somebody would just make a little thing, where you’re connected to the net at all times - I’d love to buy one. But I don’t see one of those out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all see one out there today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amy Hoy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from a conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;http://justinjackson.ca/&quot;&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackingthebricks.com/&quot;&gt;Amy Hoy&lt;/a&gt;. The two discuss building an audience and a product people actually want. You don’t have to bootstrap alone. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.productpeople.tv/52&quot;&gt;full conversation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youre-not-important&quot;&gt;You’re Not Important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everybody is every field thinks they are the ones who are critical to the success of the product. I’ve been a designer, writer, marketing type stuff - every single audience I’ve been in, has said we’re the ones who are so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially developers. Especially management. Especially marketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single area thinks they are the ones that are important. The fact is that it’s not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-freckle-targets-its-audience&quot;&gt;How Freckle targets its audience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We [&lt;a href=&quot;http://letsfreckle.com/&quot;&gt;Freckle&lt;/a&gt;] don’t try to convince people that don’t track their time to track their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always look at people who already have good habits. Because if you try to persuade someone to track their time, chances are you are going to get someone who signs up for a trial and goes “fuck this, I’m not going to track my time.” And then quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Justin]&lt;/em&gt; 
One of the favorite things you’ve told me - You can’t help people. You can only help people that helps themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem-with-businesses&quot;&gt;The Problem with Businesses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the core of the problem with so many businesses. They are all based on what the person doing them wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advice-when-starting-out&quot;&gt;Advice when starting out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog. Blog specifically about the same pains you see your audience has and help them right way. And then they’ll trust you when it comes time to sell them something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;every-decision-does-not-have-equal-weight&quot;&gt;Every Decision Does Not Have Equal Weight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I see in people that fail a lot is that they treat every decision as if it has equal weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now could I make more money if I totally, totally figure this out? Possibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I make more money if I rewrite my sales page to be more effective? Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;selfishness&quot;&gt;Selfishness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really interesting when you start to look at the media and people around you - how identity focused everything is. All of startup media is about who are they casting as a hero or anti-hero. It’s almost never about the users or customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are never mentioned in anything. Not landing pages, not puff pieces, not stories of this is why we shut down - it’s almost never, ever about the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;picking-an-audience&quot;&gt;Picking an Audience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People think my advice is to serve people that are just like them. And that’s not it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s to serve an audience that you belong too. Or have belonged too. Or sell too. Or people who want to be like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can message it. You can aim it. You can study the pain of people who specifically do stuff already. Who are already in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a good sign. Doers are doers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes. Yes, it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gary Vaynerchuk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from the 2014 SXSW Keynote with Gary Vaynerchuk. Special thanks to SXSW for hosting the video, and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/garyvee&quot;&gt;Gary&lt;/a&gt; for answering tons of questions. This is uncensored and includes lots of expletives. It’s fucking fantastic. Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyzNjPU0GqU&quot;&gt;full keynote here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology--time&quot;&gt;Technology &amp;amp; Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an entrepreneur, you should spend lots of time at night thinking about where there is inefficiency in our society and where technology can solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 things in our society we value - family and health, money, and the one no one talks about enough is time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people remember when you were at home and your internet was 100th of a second slower? Remember how fucking pissed you were?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time. People using Uber, they’re buying time. Not the service. So we value time tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So keep an eye on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cursing&quot;&gt;Cursing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up obsessed with Richard Pryor. I’ve psycho-analyzed this. Because I curse a lot on stage and it’s kind of weird. There is a lot of people in this room who have no idea who I am, who’ve been turned off by my language and can’t hear all the other good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I convinced myself at least I only curse on stage. And I don’t curse in real life. That was true in 2007, 2008, or 2009. The problem is you get into practice and it starts slowly sweeping into your regular life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve cursed at a client here or there. I’ve very comfortable in who I am. I know what my objectives are and know that they are pure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, I sometimes use my cursing as a filter. To filter out people who are only willing to look at surface level, who are not usually the kind of people I want to do business with in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-one-bad-tweet-break-a-brand&quot;&gt;Can one bad tweet break a brand?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Oil spilled all of the fucking oil into the Gulf of Mexico. And you assholes still fill up your car with it. And so do I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a complete lack of understanding of what cripples a business. The fact that billion dollar fucking brands sit in the room scared that one tweet that wasn’t so good, woe is me - you’re not going out of business. Idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe intent trumps all. We are all going to make a mistake. I actually believe in today’s society, saying you’re sorry, when none of us actually want to say it - is so powerful. Sometimes I think about doing things wrong, just so I can come out and say I’m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise you, all the brands that are worried about their tweets - they need to worry about their product. They have bigger issues at hand than some random tweet, when they got a piece of shit product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;growing-a-business&quot;&gt;Growing a Business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad’s liquor store didn’t have a lot of money. Wine Library launched in 1997 and a lot of people weren’t buying online at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I did was got myself involved in the community. I went to forums. I became active in every single wine forum. I wasn’t trying to sell them Chardonnay, I was trying to become one of them. That set me up and brought the awareness to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to build a business, when you have no user base, is to become one of the users. But acting as one of the users, instead of pitching to one of the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;career-advice&quot;&gt;Career Advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know exactly what you want to be, you need to spend as much time with people who are actually &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; already. I have this insane concept on what MBA’s should really be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These business schools are getting $100,000 or $200,000 and putting these kids in debt. And giving them nothing that is real in the actual business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 40 conversations I’ve had with a business school person are the same. They say the content is not what I’m really paying for, it’s the relationships. I’m like - you can buy those relationships for less than $150,000. You’re a bad fucking business person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice is if there is someone you want to be like, stop making money, and go spend a year with that person. Take one step back to take 10 steps forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;information-age&quot;&gt;Information Age&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is a fucking commodity. It’s never been worse to be information smart than it is today. Remember 10, 15, 20, or 40 years ago when being smart about something mattered? What do you want to know? Everything you want to know informationally is in your fucking hand, on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so pissed that my daughter is going through a school system where they are going to teach her information she has to memorize for a few minutes for a test, and then move on. When that thing is in her fucking hand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re living in a world where all the IQ value is shrinking by the second. And all the EQ value is exponentially exploding, as our reputations are becoming more and more of what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should be actually doing shit instead of memorizing shit in schools. Because it’s so ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agreed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
