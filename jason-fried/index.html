<blockquote>
<p>I love listening to him, more than talking to him. I will give you one business thing and one life thing he told us.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="business">Business</h2>

<p>The most important thing in business is to figure out what&rsquo;s <strong>not</strong> going to change in your business. And invest heavily in that.</p>

<p>A lot of businesses are focused on what&rsquo;s changing. Change. Change. Change. But he says you should do the opposite.</p>

<p>He gave me an example of Amazon. 10 years from now, people are not going to wake up and say I wish Amazon&rsquo;s selection was worse. Right. So they are going to appreciate a big selection now, and forever. Invest in big selection.</p>

<p>People are not going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Amazon&rsquo;s shipping was slower. So they can invest in Amazon&rsquo;s shipping now and it will always pay off forever.</p>

<p>People are not going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Amazon&rsquo;s customer service was crappier. So let&rsquo;s invest in customer service.</p>

<p>Find those things that are never going to change. And pour everything you have into those things.</p>

<p>For us, people are not going to wake up 10 years from now and I say I wish Basecamp was slower. So we&rsquo;ve invested heavily in performance and speed. Our app is very, very fast.</p>

<p>People are not going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Basecamp&rsquo;s customer service was crap. We&rsquo;ve been investing heavily in that. Right now, if you email Basecamp support - you will get a response in under 2 minutes. Some days under a minute. And that&rsquo;s unheard of in email response. We&rsquo;ve invested heavily in that. Because that is a great experience and people aren&rsquo;t used to that. It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>

<p>People aren&rsquo;t going to wake up 10 years from now and say I wish Basecamp was hard to use. So we have to invest in making it simpler. A lot of people want more stuff. That&rsquo;s a trick. But fundamentally people aren&rsquo;t going to want to make things harder to use.</p>

<p>So those are the places we invest. And I believe in that a lot.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>About life, he said you don&rsquo;t find your passions. Your passions find you. So when I ask him, why are you into space? He says, I don&rsquo;t know space found me.</p>

<p>I ask him why are you into a 10,000 year clock? And he says, I don&rsquo;t know that concept found me. He&rsquo;s really big into that. If you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re passionate about yet - don&rsquo;t search for it. It will find you.</p>

<p>And I thought that was a really cool piece of advice.</p>

<p><em>Me too.</em></p>
