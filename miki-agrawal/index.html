<p>*<a href="https://twitter.com/twinmiki">Miki Agrawal</a> wrote the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Do-Cool-Sh-Business-Happily/dp/0062366858/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428968871&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=do+cool+sh+t">Do Cool Sh*t</a>. This is a short transcription of jam-packed advice on starting a business.*</p>

<p><em>Miki has a direct, no nonsense approach. Her stories are powerful and eye-opening. The video is super high-energy and full of quick, actionable advice. Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWUcQcXyQp4">here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="purpose-0-31-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-31s">Purpose <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=31s">0:31</a></h2>

<p>Purpose is your best motivation. If you&rsquo;re starting a business to make money. It&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re starting a business that has a purpose, you can stand the test of time.</p>

<h2 id="what-sucks-in-my-world-1-05-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-1m5s">What sucks in my world? <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=1m5s">1:05</a></h2>

<p>I break it down in 3 sort of steps when I think about starting a business.</p>

<p>The first is what sucks in my world?</p>

<p>When I was traveling to South Africa, I met a young girl on a weekday. I was like you&rsquo;re 12 years old, it&rsquo;s a weekday, why aren&rsquo;t you in school?</p>

<p>And she said it&rsquo;s my week of shame. She proceeded to tell me when she has her period she uses old dirty rags and leaves or whatever she can find, it doesn&rsquo;t work, she ran home from school crying and eventually she stopped going.</p>

<p>I then came home to find over 100 million girls are missing from school when they have their period. What sucked in my world is I knew a girl wasn&rsquo;t going to school or missing school because of her period.</p>

<h2 id="does-it-suck-for-more-than-just-me-1-40-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-1m40s">Does it suck for more than just me? <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=1m40s">1:40</a></h2>

<p>The second question is does it suck for more than just me. It sucks for more than 2 billion girls right now because that&rsquo;s the number of women on the planet.</p>

<p>That means there is a business there. Can we take what we know, a pair of underwear, and put special technology in it?</p>

<p>And for every pair of underwear sold, we fund 7 reusable cloth pads that goes to a girl in a developing world, so she can go back to school.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="passion-1-58-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-1m58s">Passion <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=1m58s">1:58</a></h2>

<p>And third, can I be passionate about this for a really, really long time?</p>

<p>So truly think about it. Can I give up everything in business for this?</p>

<p>If the answer is no, then keep looking.</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, then go for it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="eliminate-depleters-2-08-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-2m08s">Eliminate Depleters <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=2m08s">2:08</a></h2>

<p>I think the first thing you do is you eliminate negative relationships in your life.</p>

<p>People who are the naysayers. The family members that say stay at your safe job. I call that depleters.</p>

<p>Even if they want the best for you, it&rsquo;s depleting.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not surrounding yourself with the most inspiring and supportive people, then you&rsquo;re going to be chipping away and second guessing yourself.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="iterate-2-28-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-2m28s">Iterate <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=2m28s">2:28</a></h2>

<p>The best advice I ever received is iteration is profession.</p>

<p>Put something out in the world that&rsquo;s not absolutely perfect, but you&rsquo;ll still be able to get feedback and iterate and improve and adjust.</p>

<p>Create something quickly. Create a minimum viable product, MVP, and just put it out in the world.</p>

<p>And then just see the response, and keep adjusting and keep iterating.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-can-i-help-you-2-48-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-2m48s">How can I help you? <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=2m48s">2:48</a></h2>

<p>When you&rsquo;re first starting out something, when you&rsquo;re first launching an idea, wanting to grow a business, and you need seek advice from people - oh, I want to pick your brain, I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve gotten that - that&rsquo;s just not going to a work.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re going to be like, ugh, another person wants to pick my brain.</p>

<p>If you starting by leading with how can I help you versus how can you help me, watch how doors will open.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="defining-success-3-05-https-youtu-be-qwucqcxyqp4-t-3m05s">Defining Success <a href="https://youtu.be/QWUcQcXyQp4?t=3m05s">3:05</a></h2>

<p>When I came out of college, I had so much student loan debt. So financial freedom was my goal.</p>

<p>Once I became financially free, my definition of success changed to freedom of time. To be able to do what I want to do when I want to do it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s super important. The freedom of time.</p>

<p>And now that I have freedom of time, my definition of success changed to living to my full potential, which means I can impact as many people as I can.</p>

<p><em>Thanks, Miki.</em></p>
