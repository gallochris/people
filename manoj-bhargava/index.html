<p><em>Take a half-hour and listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46-XiMOoJE">this talk</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/Manoj_Bhargava">Manoj Bhargava</a>. Manoj is founder of 5-Hour Energy, a philanthropist, and full of wisdom. The story behind the product is fascinating and Manoj&rsquo;s common sense will smack your right across the face.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks to Ryan Singer (@rjs) for sharing a <a href="https://twitter.com/rjs/status/660153222984781825">link</a> to the talk months ago. Watch and listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46-XiMOoJE">here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="two-ways-to-get-technology-1-05-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-1m5s">Two ways to get technology <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=1m5s">1:05</a></h2>

<p>There are only two ways to get technology. To invent it. Or to find it.</p>

<p>Inventing has the same chance as a lottery ticket.</p>

<p>So we formed a company that looked for technology worldwide. I liked chemistry because I thought it was a really simple thing.</p>

<p>You mix a bunch of cheap stuff together and sell it for more. That&rsquo;s basically chemistry.</p>

<p>So we had submissions from thousands of PhDs across the world. And large companies started hiring us saying, &ldquo;Can you find technology for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found out, of course, the large companies, all they have is committee meetings. They would actually never get anything done. So we dropped those contracts.</p>

<p>I found this technology at a trade show. We went there and somebody introduced us to this company. And we had a meeting with them, and at 2 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I said, &ldquo;I have 8 hours of meetings and I&rsquo;m not making it. I&rsquo;m not able to get through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went back to them and said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you have some energy something. Can I try that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They gave me this thing and I said, &ldquo;Woah, this I can sell.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-it-s-a-small-bottle-2-57-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-2m57s">Why it&rsquo;s a small bottle <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=2m57s">2:57</a></h2>

<p>It took me about 30 days. What I did was instead of making a large drink, I did a small one.</p>

<p>The reason is a few things.</p>

<p>One, I thought why is someone tired and thirsty at the same time. That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. So why not make it small?</p>

<p>And the other thing was from the retail level. Do I have a big bottle and compete against Coke and Pepsi for the cooler space? That sounded really dumb. So I said, &ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s not do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I make it small and I&rsquo;m in the front and I&rsquo;m by the counter, I&rsquo;m competing against keychains and batteries. I can handle that.</p>

<p>So we made it small. The first one was 1 ounce, unfortunately, you couldn&rsquo;t read it. So we made it 2 ounces.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="don-t-do-dumb-stuff-4-25-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-4m25s">Don&rsquo;t do dumb stuff <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=4m25s">4:25</a></h2>

<p>I had no experience in consumer products. All we were armed with was common sense and hey, we can do this.</p>

<p>This is not a big deal.</p>

<p>We started with the trunk slammers. The guys who throw stuff in the back of their car and go to store to store peddling stuff. We started there.</p>

<p>Then we got into drug stores. Then we got into Walmart.</p>

<p>Now, we have 4 different items at every Walmart at checkout, which is the most difficult space in the world to get.</p>

<p>We became one of the largest consumer products in the world. We are the largest dietary supplement product in the world.</p>

<p>Really, all of it was common sense stuff. I tell people, we weren&rsquo;t that smart.</p>

<p>The only thing we did was we just didn&rsquo;t do dumb stuff.</p>

<p>And that really, pretty much, differentiated us from all corporations.</p>

<p>Even to this day, people say, &ldquo;How many people do you have?</p>

<p>In our offices, everything all together, we have 65 people. Not including our plant, which has 250, run as a separate company.</p>

<p>They say, &ldquo;Wow, you must be really efficient?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I say, &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not efficient at all to tell you the truth. We just don&rsquo;t do useless stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All I did was cut out everything that didn&rsquo;t make money or didn&rsquo;t improve the product or didn&rsquo;t make the customer happy. It&rsquo;s got to go.</p>

<p>And doing that, you get rid of hundreds and hundreds of potential things. We don&rsquo;t do strategic initiatives. I can&rsquo;t even spell that stuff.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="jargon-6-39-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-6m39s">Jargon <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=6m39s">6:39</a></h2>

<p>We stayed out of jargon, partly because I&rsquo;m not familiar with all the MBA stuff. There is so much jargon and I can&rsquo;t spell most of it.</p>

<p>And I think the people who use it also don&rsquo;t understand it. But they have to use it.</p>

<p>How many times have you gotten a resume and every second line there is strategic?</p>

<p>We just did it differently. We said just use common sense and just go. And do it now.</p>

<p>To give you an example, most of the meetings last about a minute or two. Because most of the time it&rsquo;s like a decision of saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the roof, should I take the stairs or the fast way down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really not a decision. And yet they&rsquo;ll schedule a half-hour or hour meeting with 18 people.</p>

<p>Should we jump off the roof or take the stairs?</p>

<p>Most of the time, at least the people we have, would rather take the stairs.</p>

<p>We did really simple stuff. And our whole job is to make the business really simple.</p>

<p>It usually flies in the face of all experts. Experts do not like simple.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="on-giving-away-90-of-his-money-8-31-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-8m31s">On giving away 90% of his money? <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=8m31s">8:31</a></h2>

<p>I have two choices. I can wreck my son&rsquo;s life or I can give it away.</p>

<p>So, do really stupid stuff or do not do stupid stuff?</p>

<p>We decided let&rsquo;s go this way and not do dumb stuff. Today, we are the largest charity in India that nobody knows.</p>

<p>The other guys are nice, but they tend to do more announcements that work. We don&rsquo;t have anything big or fancy to gauge how well we&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>The only thing we look for is how many people that are underprivileged, did we significantly affect.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Because you really don&rsquo;t know, sitting behind a fancy desk in an air conditioned office, what they need out there.</p>

<p>One guy, one of these big shot billionaires sitting behind these desks, said, &ldquo;How should we do this, so it&rsquo;s sustainable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got a little annoyed. I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about you. It&rsquo;s about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you have a business, it&rsquo;s about a customer. The same way you go out to a field and find out what do they need, and then do that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-we-work-in-our-company-17-21-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-17m15s">How we work in our company <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=17m15s">17:21</a></h2>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have MBA speak. If someone comes to me with an a project or something that needs to be done, the first question I&rsquo;ll ask is, &ldquo;Is this useful? How is it useful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if it&rsquo;s not useful, it better be entertaining.</p>

<p>And if it&rsquo;s not useful or entertaining, there is only one other basket left. That&rsquo;s useless.</p>

<p>To us, business is really not rocket science. It&rsquo;s just do useful stuff. And avoid useless.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-s-an-expert-18-38-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-18m38s">What&rsquo;s an expert? <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=18m38s">18:38</a></h2>

<p>An expert is someone who knows everything that was. He&rsquo;s really good at what was.</p>

<p>And if you ask him about what will be, he&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;No, no that cannot be done. Because I&rsquo;m an expert of what was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why would I need you?</p>

<p>Because if I want to do what was, I don&rsquo;t have a business.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="prime-directive-19-35-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-19m35s">Prime Directive <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=19m35s">19:35</a></h2>

<p>We have what&rsquo;s called the prime directive. If any of you watch Star Trek, there is a prime directive.</p>

<p>The prime directive in our company is no aggravation. Nobody gets to give us aggravation. Whether it&rsquo;s customers, vendors, employees.</p>

<p>If you aggravate, you got to go. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s really business. Usually it&rsquo;s the one percent, some customer that has one percent of your business and he&rsquo;s driving you nuts. And he&rsquo;s taking up 80 percent of your head.</p>

<p>How is that business? Aggravation is the largest cost in business.</p>

<p>To me, it&rsquo;s really simple, we live here at the work. If an employee is such that they&rsquo;re going to cause havoc or aggravate, they need to go.</p>

<p>One time, one of our senior guys yelled at a receptionist. I called him in and said, &ldquo;Look. You can&rsquo;t yell at her. You can fire her. If it&rsquo;s that bad, they need to go. But we live here, don&rsquo;t mess up this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that aggravation, if you avoid it, not only do you have fun, it&rsquo;s a great place to work and nobody quits.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t get people to quit.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="risk-takers-21-21-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-21m21s">Risk takers <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=21m21s">21:21</a></h2>

<p>Somebody asked me should we have risk takers?</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs. Risk takers.</p>

<p>I said no, no, no. Entrepreneurs are not risk takers. If someone in my company wants to take risks, I say, &ldquo;Go work somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our job as entrepreneurs is to minimize risks. To manage risk. To give the risk to somebody else. Not take it.</p>

<p>If you want to take risks, go to Vegas.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-entrepreneurs-really-need-23-24-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-23m24s">What entrepreneurs really need <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=23m24s">23:24</a></h2>

<p>All jargon does is bury common sense. All entrepreneurs need is two things.</p>

<p>All they need is two things. Common sense. And a sense of urgency.</p>

<p>They asked who should we learn this stuff from?</p>

<p>My answer was your mom.</p>

<p>Because she has probably done more management than your MBA professor.</p>

<p>Because she&rsquo;s got a budget. All these kids running around. Hard to manage. All of these things have to be done seven days a week. Now that&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hard work. That&rsquo;s learning on the job.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="mbas-25-05-https-youtu-be-x46-ximooje-t-25m5s">MBAs <a href="https://youtu.be/x46-XiMOoJE?t=25m5s">25:05</a></h2>

<p>I think MBA is totally useless. I&rsquo;m not saying they don&rsquo;t teach anything of value. I think they teach this much that is useful. They teach this much that is useless. And they teach this much that is harmful.</p>

<p>Overall, average is on the useless side.</p>

<p>Because you come out of school and you actually think you know something. Really? And that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>

<p>Because you really don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I never hire people out of fancy schools for that reason. My first question usually to an MBA is, &ldquo;How are you going to get over it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple thing. If you&rsquo;re going to learn plumbing, go learn from a plumber that has actually seen a pipe. That has fixed a leak.</p>

<p>Not just written about pipes, lectured on pipes, and researched pipes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not for theoretical plumbers.</p>

<p><em>Me either, Manoj.</em></p>
