<p><em>James Yancey aka J Dilla deserves to be in the same sentence as John Coltrane and Miles Davis.</em></p>

<p><em>J Dilla joins Gilles Peterson&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gillespetersonworldwide.com/">World Wide</a> in 2001 to speak on several tracks from his solo album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_2_Detroit">Welcome 2 Detroit</a>, and other collaboration and production tidbits. Listen to the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/92bpm/jay-dee-w-gilles-petersons">30 minute interview here</a> and read the transcription below.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="welcome-to-detroit-2-59">Welcome to Detroit 2:59</h2>

<p>Well the title Welcome 2 Detroit is welcoming you to Detroit! The realness, it&rsquo;s about that.</p>

<p>The compilation basically came about from a break beat album, Idea, that Peter from BBE had, which turned into giving Jay Dee 100 percent creative control.</p>

<p>Basically he let me do whatever I wanted to do. So I wanted put people on there who was going to spit, lyrically, and represent each Detroit. Because I wouldn&rsquo;t of been able to pull this album off if it came under a major [label].</p>

<p>Because they&rsquo;re not going to just let you do a song or do an instrumental. You got to have this feature. And you Jay Dee, why don&rsquo;t you have Erykah Badu or so so on your album.</p>

<p>I had to go through all of that instead of just putting out beats on this joint.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="think-twice-4-15">Think Twice 4:15</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zUFkQNBqoU">Think Twice song</a>, the Donald Byrd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7qcPCUn44E">cover</a>, basically to make a long story short it&rsquo;s one of my favorite cuts.</p>

<p>I always wanted to replay it, sample it, anything. So that&rsquo;s why I messed with that.</p>

<p>I just wanted to also get it to sound like something I would find digging. You know sonically, for those that don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s very hard to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I did it. But it&rsquo;s really hard. When I listen to a Roots album, it&rsquo;s like they did a lot a work. They did a lot of work to get that sound.</p>

<p>Because you compare that to an Acid jazz group that does the same thing, plays the same instruments, records live and everything, sonically, it just doesn&rsquo;t sound the same. It&rsquo;s more of a raw sound.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bbe-6-00">BBE 6:00</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Rg5e73sfY">BBE</a>, moving on, I wanted to do something if you hear it, you&rsquo;ll hear trans europ express, that&rsquo;s why I was trying to get across, but in my own way basically.</p>

<p>It reminds me of some terminator theme music. And that&rsquo;s where the melodies come from the strings and the whole direction of that song.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-to-expect-7-21">What to Expect 7:21</h2>

<p>Right now, what to expect is whatever I ain&rsquo;t touched on. It&rsquo;s what to expect you can say.</p>

<p>Anything I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;m not about to do.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s my word. Y&rsquo;all going to see it. Bear witness. Like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7vkD6ZT664">Rico Suave Bossa Nova</a>. You know just show people a little difference.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="runnin-9-10">Runnin&rsquo; 9:10</h2>

<p>Check it out y&rsquo;all, got a little story for you. I&rsquo;m going to tell y&rsquo;all about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwHuEDCM7xs">Runnin&rsquo;</a>. You know Pharcyde.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a fight out of that song from members of the group.</p>

<p>Because the 950 filter sounds better than the ASR-10. That was the argument. And that was the fight.</p>

<p>I mean a fight. A fight. That&rsquo;s one just one instance.</p>

<p>Not to mention the others. I&rsquo;ve done seen this cat get his arm broke. And cats with leopard skin boxers on, their pants coming down.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, man, the making of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJAsMo-A_q0">Pharcyde Labcabincalifornia album</a> was hilarious. It was just all the way around.</p>

<p>It got me prepared for what was ahead in this rap game. Is Pharcyde still together? You know?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="bootleggers-11-25">Bootleggers 11:25</h2>

<p>I remember coming to World Wide, almost 2 years ago, I was in the middle of doing a Slum Village joint. That whole album, that was an experience you know.</p>

<p>They said we went platinum in the streets. Multi-platinum because everybody got bootlegged. Everybody. Different companies got bootlegged to the point when it finally came out, everyone already had it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all good. To speak on it, I really thank you. I thank the bootleggers because you actually helped me.</p>

<p>Because that gave me, I guess you would say a little power. In this industry, it&rsquo;s needed being an artist who wants to change things and wants to do something different.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t do it alone, basically. It took all of that bootlegging for the labels to look at it and say, &ldquo;This is actually, people want this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get on it. I appreciate it. It&rsquo;s cool with me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="working-with-common-13-46">Working with Common 13:46</h2>

<p>Working with Common, I tell everybody, it&rsquo;s like working with Slum, Frank-n-Dank, Phat Cat. That&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s a midwest cat.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s automatically, he&rsquo;s connected with us. Damn near staying in the D [Detroit]. He&rsquo;d been coming to Detroit for the longest.</p>

<p>I kind of knew what he wanted. He gave me an idea, a direction he wanted to go, basically, just let me do my thing after that.</p>

<p>Whatever you bring is what we&rsquo;re going to do. From hooks to beats to whatever.</p>

<p><em>Common speaks on Dilla</em> 14:25</p>

<p>Jay Dee is one of the best producers to ever touch it. Point blank.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been so innovative with his sound and so like progressive with it. Even though you know his feel, it&rsquo;s like he can give anybody what they need really.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s got a certain funk to it. A special thing about it. I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t put my finger all the way on it.</p>

<p>Basically from the work he did with Tribe from him producing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN6PoMDI-s8">Janet Jackson song</a>, on and on it seems to go. He ghost produced that.</p>

<p>Many people don&rsquo;t know. If you listen, you can tell he ghost produced that.</p>

<p>From the work he did with Busta, even Pharcyde and Slum Village. People just feeling it.</p>

<p>I can say this from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulquarians">Soulquarians</a> perspective. People like QuestLove, D&rsquo;Angelo, and James Poyser - they all sit and study Jay Dee. He&rsquo;s like the genius behind it.</p>

<p>He was the one where they sit, and wonder how does he do this or that, and they start trying to play similar to him.</p>

<p>Not like they don&rsquo;t have their own thing. The point of the matter is they do look to him for inspiration, as do many producers.</p>

<p>All I can say is the boy is dope.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-ummah-and-q-tip-17-25">The Ummah and Q-Tip 17:25</h2>

<p>The Ummah consists of 4 cats. Raphael Saadiq, Jay Dee (myself), Ali and Q-Tip of Tribe Called Quest.</p>

<p>I want to speak on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN6PoMDI-s8">Got &lsquo;Til It&rsquo;s Gone</a> by Janet Jackson. Who really did the production?</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis beat. That&rsquo;s not to say any names, but it just doesn&rsquo;t sound like it. I know they could of done it.</p>

<p>Why is Q-Tip rapping on it? It sounds like a Tribe beat. We all had an input into that. Me, Tip, and Ali.</p>

<p>In this game, there is cats coming up producing, and have joints come up and your name is not on it. You know?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all good. It&rsquo;s all good in the end. You just got to stay focused.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH2BTUACBVc">Beats, Rhymes, and Life</a> and from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Movement">Love Movement</a>, Q-Tip, from day one, we&rsquo;ve been on the same page. Always. Creatively.</p>

<p>Working on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4195A8AC085B435B">Q-Tip album</a>, I Just used to send him joints. It was love like that. He used to get beat zip discs.</p>

<p>I never send that to anybody else, you know what I&rsquo;m saying. But I trusted him like that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="d-angelo-20-21">D&rsquo;Angelo 20:21</h2>

<p>I got a D&rsquo;Angelo story, going back working on the Slum album. The illest thing I can remember is going to the studio and seeing D&rsquo;Angelo.</p>

<p>It was him and Ahmir Thompson, but this cat comes in, D&rsquo;Angelo comes in first with a cigarette, just chilling, kicking it, whatever.</p>

<p>And he gets behind this fender rows. You know I jammed with him before, but this was the first time we were recording. We were about to put something down.</p>

<p>I swear I have DATs at the crib of playing, just him and Amir. It seemed like it was all night. Different grooves too. Ok, we&rsquo;ll use this one.</p>

<p>I just got to say he is, the thing he does with that keyboard, you can&rsquo;t play like that. He&rsquo;s got his own thing. He&rsquo;s like Stevie Wonder with that.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the Soulquarians crew. D&rsquo;Angelo, myself, Ahmir, and James Poyser.</p>

<p>We automatically clicked. The Aquarian thing. Come to find out, we&rsquo;re all aquarian.</p>

<p>Basically I mean Ahmir is in my head. I can say this, Ahmir, if I could just pull him out of my head, he would be the drum kit I would use on joints. Because it&rsquo;s unlimited. It&rsquo;s unlimited the things he can do with that.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Angelo would be the keyboard player. The song arranger in my head. It&rsquo;s unlimited. Like if I have samples I want to play, he&rsquo;ll do it, just like that he&rsquo;ll play.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s drums I want to loop in, Ahmir will come in, and put it right there. The EQ. Just like &lsquo;em.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s definitely good to have them two brothers in my pocket. Whew, because that&rsquo;s some serious business.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find talent like that. What I consider the best of the best right here. It&rsquo;s like okay, what do we do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to touch everything. I tried to it in this little compilation, I tried to touch a couple areas. But we&rsquo;re going to really try to take it somewhere else. Really try to take it there.</p>

<p>And try a complete album.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="future-of-music-26-04">Future of Music 26:04</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how things work. I have to say I&rsquo;m blessed to have the opportunity to work with such artists.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how things come together. And people come together.</p>

<p>Like I think this music. This whole thing is about to do a 360. In a good way.</p>

<p>I think the good music is coming back around. People are making, I wouldn&rsquo;t say good music, people are making things they&rsquo;re honestly proud of. That they feel. That&rsquo;s truly them.</p>

<p>Thank God first. People are starting to accept this Common single, which is somebody who never sold over 125,000 units before.</p>

<p>Now, he&rsquo;s got a Gold album and the single is doing well. It&rsquo;s good to see that it&rsquo;s turning around.</p>

<p>To see the Roots go get a Grammy a couple years ago. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be all watered down, non-original stuff you hear every day. It can be a little bit of everything.</p>

<p>I know myself and the people I work with, as far as Common to Busta, all these artists, De La Soul, we all have this goal.</p>

<p>I guess this goal is to we want to change things. Make a statement.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="erykah-badu-27-33">Erykah Badu 27:33</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell y&rsquo;all a story. Check me out. Here&rsquo;s a nice juicy one.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re working on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama%27s_Gun">Erykah Badu album</a>. She&rsquo;s at the crib. She makes this tea for us.</p>

<p>But today, for whatever reason, I have a headache. Crazy headache.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re chilling upstairs. I tell her, I&rsquo;m going to chill out for a minute.</p>

<p>Now, the beats are banging upstairs. She&rsquo;s writing. I&rsquo;m just going to take a breather. It&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p>She comes upstairs and fixes me some tea. You notice my voice change.</p>

<p>She fixed me some tea, sat on the couch with me. The next thing you know I&rsquo;m getting a massage from Erykah Badu. Mhm. On top of me. Straddled. While I&rsquo;m on the couch.</p>

<p>Now, nothing happened. It was just nice to have Erykah on my lap. Immediately after that, we made the track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VxI5k7ih2g">Kiss Me on My Neck</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="influences-29-31">Influences 29:31</h2>

<p>Some influences <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown">James Brown</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McDuff">Jack McDuff</a>. These are all people, I grew up listening to in my household.</p>

<p>Classical music, I can&rsquo;t even name anything. My mother listened to classical music.</p>

<p>Old doo-wop music. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platters">Platters</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Freshmen">Four Freshman</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>. Probably a Stereolab Omar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Tek">Hi-Tek</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/Timbaland">Timbaland</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/madlib">Madlib</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmgB84swpIE">Feather, Going Through Changes</a>. I don&rsquo;t know why I think of that. It&rsquo;s on Discovery Records.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the joints I did use on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH2BTUACBVc">Beats, Rhymes, and Life album</a>. This song is a good song to listen to. So I definitely recommend that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="thank-you-james">Thank you, James</h2>

<p>That was the whole interview. Dilla is a legend. His <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/55953-j-dilla-equipment-will-be-donated-to-smithsonian-museum/">MPC is in the Smithsonian</a>.</p>

<p>I first heard Dilla listening to my brother&rsquo;s old Pharcyde compact discs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwHuEDCM7xs">Runnin&rsquo;</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1DEBbbck6c">Splatittorium</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co3qMdkucM0">Drop</a>.</p>

<p>Holy shit. That&rsquo;s all I could say. The drums and the swings instantly put me in a better mood. And I had no clue who Dilla was back then.</p>

<p>I listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zs2By9H6t8">Common&rsquo;s Like Water for Chocolate</a>. Q-Tips solo ablum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4Z-PUOoHAg&amp;list=PL91727DA77FDC828A">Amplified</a>. Slum Village on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jqKyfrsr5k">Office Space Soundtrack</a>.</p>

<p>My goodness, this music was incredible. I started to figure out who he was. And when I did, I also learned he was sick.</p>

<p>Real sick. Dilla was living with lupus. He <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/j-dilla-dead-at-thirty-two-20060213">passed away</a> February 10, 2006.</p>

<p>He continues to inspire millions with his music. Earlier this month, on his birthday, I came across an interview from 2001 and it was a pleasure transcribing it.</p>
