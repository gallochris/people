<p><em>The following is an excerpt from 2010 Gov 2.0 Expo with Kathy Sierra. She has given this talk several times and spread the message on her <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">blog</a>. Special thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OreillyMedia">O&rsquo;Reilly Media</a> for hosting the video. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM55NiXSOPs">full talk here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="kicking-ass">Kicking Ass</h2>

<p>Where there is passion, there are people kicking ass. People don&rsquo;t sustain passion for things they continue to suck at.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that passion is compelling for people is because when they are pursing something, learning and growing - they start to have a higher resolution. They have deeper, richer experiences for the things they are passionate about.</p>

<p>For example, the more you learn about a particular style of music - you actually hear more than the rest of us. You hear subtleties. It&rsquo;s as if the music changed it&rsquo;s resolution.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="higher-resolution">Higher Resolution</h2>

<p>High resolution means deeper, richer experiences. And that&rsquo;s the kind of thing we need to create for people or we&rsquo;re not going to have passion.</p>

<p>Because it always exists where there is passion.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="create-killer-users">Create Killer Users</h2>

<p>Yeah, this is an obvious thing. But it&rsquo;s amazing how little we focus on that when we want people to become passionate. Because we are so focused on our role.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to make better products. We&rsquo;re going to make better services. We&rsquo;re going to deliver better things for people.</p>

<p>They really don&rsquo;t care what you do. I&rsquo;m not passionate about what you do. I&rsquo;m passionate about what <em>I</em> do. It&rsquo;s your job to enable that.</p>

<p>Quit thinking about making a better &ldquo;x&rdquo;. Think about making a better user of &ldquo;x&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For example, I work with authors a lot. This distinction can mean ripping out 200 pages that are designed to make the author look smart. And adding 200 pages that make the actual reader smart.</p>

<p>As programmers, you&rsquo;re familiar with the idea of making a killer app. But that&rsquo;s not what we want to make if we want passion. We need to create a killer user.</p>

<p>That is a different mindset. And it might be a completely different feature set. When you stop thinking about what you&rsquo;re delivering, and start thinking about what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p><em>Brilliant.</em></p>
