<p><em>Joe Gebbia is the co-founder of <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/03/08/joe-gebbia-co-founder-of-airbnb/">Airbnb</a>. This is a super long conversation with Tim Ferriss on his podcast. Tons of entertaining stories, including a high school senior prank and working as a ballboy meeting Michael Jordan.</em></p>

<p><em>A lot of useful tidbits too. At the end of the conversation, Joe offered a good summary of takeaways from all that he shared, so I transcribed the last few minutes. Watch and listen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xao9DJEpk8I">whole conversation here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="entrepreneurship-is-2-31-44-https-youtu-be-xao9djepk8i-t-2h31m44s">Entrepreneurship is  <a href="https://youtu.be/Xao9DJEpk8I?t=2h31m44s">2:31:44</a></h2>

<p>I hope if there is any takeaway from the stories we talked about today is that there is just a long lineage of trying things, bumping into walls, getting rejected, failing, reframing that failure into learning, and trying to continue forward.</p>

<p>So by the time Airbnb came around, I had been in the gym of entrepreneurship for many years. It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t wake up and run a marathon all of a sudden. Nobody does that. You train for it.</p>

<p>So the time it&rsquo;s ready for race day, your body is conditioned for it. Your body and muscles, everything is ready for you to go run 26 miles.</p>

<p>And I think entrepreneurship is the exact same way. I think it&rsquo;s a misconception when people look at the magazine covers and read the stories of successful companies, they think, wow, people started that and built it, and everybody came. That couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>I think <em>Field of Dreams</em> is probably the worst movie that ever happened to entrepreneurship. Because it created this idea, if you build it, they will come. And I can tell you if you build it, they won&rsquo;t come.</p>

<p>It takes this incredible perseverance and sometimes irrational belief in yourself to bring something to life in front of a lot of adversity and a lot of people saying it can&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p>So, I hope if there is any takeaway from the stories I shared today it&rsquo;s that the simple act of spotting an opportunity, coming up with an original solution, and taking the third hardest step - putting something into the world, trying something, putting your idea into practice.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the big idea. It&rsquo;s about being in the gym and doing a rep, the gym of entrepreneurship. It&rsquo;s just getting in the habit of doing those three things. You spot an opportunity, you come up with a solution, and you put your idea into the world.</p>

<p>The more you can do that, the better you are at spotting the opportunity. And Airbnb just happened to be a part of the lineage of all of things I told you that happened before.</p>

<h2 id="the-equation-2-33-54-https-youtu-be-xao9djepk8i-t-2h33m54s">The equation  <a href="https://youtu.be/Xao9DJEpk8I?t=2h33m54s">2:33:54</a></h2>

<p><code>sw² + wc = mo</code></p>

<p>So, what that stands for is when you introduce a new idea to the world &hellip;</p>

<p>Some will love it, some won&rsquo;t, plus who cares equals move on.</p>

<p>Keeping going until you find the people that love your idea.</p>
