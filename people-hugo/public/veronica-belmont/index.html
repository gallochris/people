<p><em><a href="http://veronicabelmont.com/">Veronica Belmont</a> helps people understand how technology can better their lives. She is the product Manager at Disco, and involved in lots of other things across the web.</em></p>

<p><em>Veronica answers two questions from Tim Ferriss. Her responses are short, but powerful. You can listen to the answers on the <a href="https://art19.com/shows/tim-ferriss-show/episodes/aca07cd4-ffea-4975-825e-daf00953ed27">Tim Ferriss show</a>. Her interview starts at around the 43-minute mark.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-bad-recommendations-you-hear-in-your-industry">What are some bad recommendations you hear in your industry?</h2>

<p>I think people assume you have to weigh all feedback on your product or podcast or app equally. Not all feedback is created equal. And not all ideas from your users are going to be good ones.</p>

<p>Taking too much stock in feedback can change the vision for your product, and suddenly it&rsquo;s not going to feel like yours anymore.</p>

<h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-the-smart-driven-college-student-about-to-enter-the-real-world-what-advice-do-you-think-they-should-they-ignore">What advice would you give to the smart, driven college student about to enter the real world? What advice do you think they should they ignore?</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t wait until you get a job to do the thing you want to be doing. For most careers, showing that you have initiative by working on projects related to your future hopeful job is an amazing way to get your foot in the door.</p>

<p>So for example, if you want to be a writer or journalist, start keeping a blog that you update regularly. Something that you can show them later, that says I&rsquo;ve been writing about this topic for the last year now. I&rsquo;m an expert in this area.</p>

<p>If you want to be an engineer or programmer, create and maintain a project on GitHub. GitHub is basically like the new resume. Anything you can point to on your LinkedIn that is screaming, &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;m passionate about this stuff!&rdquo; is going to work.</p>
