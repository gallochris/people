      <description>Nassim Nicholas Taleb gives a short introduction to the idea of antifragility. This concept is covered in length in Taleb&amp;rsquo;s book, Antifragile Thingss That Gain From Disorder. It&amp;rsquo;s part of a series of books from Taleb. The others are Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan, and The Bed of Procrustes.
This book and interview are difficult to understand. It&amp;rsquo;s quite the idea and concept, but Taleb knows that too. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a few great summaries here that can help: Max Mednik&amp;rsquo;s extensive notes, notes from Nat Alison and four minute book notes.</description>
