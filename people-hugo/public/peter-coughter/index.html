<h2 id="nervous-and-scared">Nervous and Scared</h2>

<p>Yesterday morning, I was in my car and I was listening to a sports talk show. And we can learn things from all kinds of different places by the way.</p>

<p>I was listening to Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees, who is arguably the greatest relief pitcher of all time. And this is a guy who comes in when the game is in the balance, usually trying to protect a very slim lead and there&rsquo;s usually people on base. There&rsquo;s a difficult hitter at-bat. And it&rsquo;s his job to retire the side and preserve the win for his team amidst the greatest form of pressure you can find in that business of baseball.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s done it more times, more successfully, than anybody else. The fellow interviewing him, asked if he was nervous. And this guy has been doing this for a long time.</p>

<p>And he said of course I&rsquo;m nervous. When I come in from the bullpen and the walk in - I&rsquo;m really, really nervous. And he&rsquo;s done this several thousand times.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s the same thing with presenting. I think you should be nervous. In fact, Mr. Rivera says that. He said if I wasn&rsquo;t nervous walking into the mound, I&rsquo;d be upset with myself. I need to be nervous then. But once the game starts, once they put the ball in my hand, I&rsquo;m not nervous at all anymore - to be nervous then would be a disaster.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of parallels in that. It&rsquo;s certainly the way I try to approach it. It&rsquo;s natural to be nervous. The best presenters I know are nervous. But once they get going - it goes away.</p>

<p>The chemical changes that take place in the body when we&rsquo;re really excited or when we&rsquo;re really scared are exactly the same. They&rsquo;re identical. So let&rsquo;s choose to go with the excitement side.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-not-to-present">How not to present</h2>

<p>This whole idea of what people think a presentation is (with big quotes around it) - is completely screwed up now. People lay the foundation of their own failure. Because they follow these conventions.</p>

<p>Stop talking about this thing as if it was a presentation. Just don&rsquo;t think about it that way anymore. Just don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;and now Peter will talk about &hellip;&rdquo; - no, don&rsquo;t do that. Peter just starts talking.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re seeing a movie or a play, the guy doesn&rsquo;t say and now he exits stage left.</p>

<p>I love when people say, &ldquo;and this slide you can see and a couple slides later from now.&rdquo; Shut up with that. Stop it.</p>

<p>The other one is a ridiculously awful to read slide comes up - and they say, &ldquo;I know this is an eye chart and I know you can&rsquo;t see this, but&rdquo;. Then why did you put it on the screen, you idiot.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the eye witness news collection of presenting. And the audience thinks what a  bunch of bozos.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-to-get-the-audience-to-like-you">How to get the Audience to like you</h2>

<p>People seem to think if we tell the audience everything we know about a particular subject, the audience will like us. And they&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re smart. And neither of which is true.</p>

<p>If we actually give the hour and half presentation in a half  hour, and give a hour of their lives back to them - then they will like us.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="telling-stories">Telling Stories</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s how we learn. There is book that&rsquo;s been for hundreds of years. It&rsquo;s called the Bible. And all it is - stories.</p>

<p>There is no bullet points in there. It&rsquo;s just stories. There&rsquo;s not a whole lot of facts. And that book is more successful than any book that has ever been written. It&rsquo;s what people turn to when they need inspiration.</p>

<p>We have to tell stories. It&rsquo;s a series of hopefully personal, germane stories that add up to one big narrative arc. That&rsquo;s tied together by the through line.</p>

<p>And when you do that, it&rsquo;s magical. It&rsquo;s just magical.</p>

<p>What it takes is sitting down and thinking about one&rsquo;s own life. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times when I&rsquo;ve been sitting down with the team and ask what about you - and they&rsquo;ll say yeah I did something that is absolutely specific to what we&rsquo;re talking about in the presentation. This is what they weren&rsquo;t going to include because it wasn&rsquo;t germane. When in reality it&rsquo;s the only thing I really want them to talk about.</p>

<p>Forget all that other bullshit. Tell them your story.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="business-jargon">Business Jargon</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not shoot ourselves in the foot by being so smart that we&rsquo;re dumb. It annoys me all the time. Business jargon.</p>

<p>There is so much crap. The next person that says to me - &ldquo;and now I&rsquo;m going to take a deep dive.&rdquo; I know I said I wouldn&rsquo;t drop an f-bomb, but fuck you with your deep dive. Stop it. Get out of here with that crap.</p>

<p>Make it human. And simple. That doesn&rsquo;t mean dumb. It means simple.</p>

<p><em>Amen.</em></p>
