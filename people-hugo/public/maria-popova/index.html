<p><em>This is a conversation from the Employee of the Month podcast. <a href="https://twitter.com/catielazarus">Catie Lazarus</a> and Maria Popova talk through life and learning. Popova curates an amazing blog called <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a> and runs a discovery engine called <a href="http://explore.noodle.org/">Explore</a>. It&rsquo;s impossible not to find inspiration in her work and this talk. Listen to the full <a href="https://soundcloud.com/employeeofthemonthshow/popova-maria">45 minute conversation here</a> and check out excerpts below.</em></p>

<h2 id="how-did-brain-pickings-start">How did Brain Pickings Start?</h2>

<p>What I do always has two components. And they are always sequential like that. Learning. And then teaching. Or learning and sharing the process of that learning.</p>

<p>So it is always about perpetual learning. It actually all began in the confines of the liberal arts institution that I went to and felt let down by academically and intellectually.</p>

<p>And it just became the record of what I wanted to learn about. It has commonality with the liberal arts. I guess it has the freedom of subjectivity.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="are-you-worried-you-won-t-own-what-you-create">Are you worried you won&rsquo;t own what you create?</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, what I do is still for an audience of one. It&rsquo;s still for me. And what I retain is in my head is enough for me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s lovely that all of these people have sort of tagged along. It&rsquo;s heartening to hear from someone that they never were into science, but now they&rsquo;re reading Carl Sagan. That&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>But what stays with me is what I&rsquo;ve absorbed and the dots that I&rsquo;ve connected. And my understanding, as cheesy as it sounds, that&rsquo;s what it all comes down to - the meaning of life.</p>

<p>Why are we here? What matters? And why?</p>

<p>And that no one can take away. Of course in very petty and practical terms, Brain Pickings was included in the library of Congress archive of culturally meaningful material - whatever that means. So they&rsquo;re recording something, I have no idea, on what and how it lives. But it&rsquo;s somehow being archived.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="fear">Fear</h2>

<p>Our biggest fear, as humans, is that we don&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>Everything that people do from creating a magnificent piece of art to having a child to even in some very warped and distorted way, a terrorist performing an act of terrorism  - all of these things are some form of grasping to wanting to matter or change the world to your liking or to a way in which your existence impacts it.</p>

<p>And having those touchstones, as you call it, are little reminders that we exist. And that we matter. We&rsquo;re not just the frivolous stroke of some creator or a bunch of atoms that dissolve one day and go away.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-did-you-build-brain-pickings-into-a-business">How did you build Brain Pickings into a business?</h2>

<p>The business part has always been a by-product. I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 7 years. The first 5 years I was flat-broke.</p>

<p>When I moved to New York in 2010, I could not afford the security deposit to my apartment. I was $80 short after I took all of my savings out of my savings account. I went to an ATM took $80 out and put it back in my checking account to give to my landlord.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how broke I was. And on top of that, I have a student loan, credit card debt - the usual.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t at that point think of Brain Pickings as a business at all. I never did. And I still don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>There were some decisions I made in the beginning - like not to have advertising. I never wanted to have that. I think there is a lot of distortion between public knowledge and information when there is a 3rd party organization involved.</p>

<p>I think a lot of reason why Brain Pickings can be what it is and have financial stability now, is it&rsquo;s all relationships. And I don&rsquo;t mean networking.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s people that years ago that I reached out and said I love what you do and I want to support it. I can&rsquo;t do it financially now, but maybe we can have something that cross-pollinates audiences. Similar people reached out to me in the same way.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just sort of mind-melding. You find your people. You find your tribe. And you find sort of this implicit guild of sensibility and idealism, whatever you want to call it. And that&rsquo;s powerful stuff.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s so off-putting when we refer to writing as content. What are we filling with this content. It&rsquo;s garbage bins - fill it with the content.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really about shaping the container in the mind that contains it. That&rsquo;s what it should be about.</p>

<p>The content is the commodification of knowledge and information and point of view that is just disgusting to me.</p>

<p>As far as curation goes, we&rsquo;ve deviated so far from the original concept of it. From an artistic museum standpoint, a curator used to be someone that puts together a show that has a point of view that consists of these different pieces that are strung together by a narrative. And by a framework of sense making.</p>

<p>And now everybody with an Instagram feed is a curator of life. And granted there are some fantastic Instagram feeds that are curatorial in nature. That there is a consistent narrative and sensibility.</p>

<p>By in large, we apply to aggregation and all of these ways of handling content. That to me, is so frustrating.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-content-is-off-putting">Why Content is Off-Putting?</h2>

<p>The fundamental reason it&rsquo;s like this is because advertising is still the currency in which media is funded. So a lot of what people call content is really that. A vehicle to advertising. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the substance is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s monetizable because it&rsquo;s filling pages or drawing click throughs. It&rsquo;s the same with air time, you have to have something to sell advertising against.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think that is not in the public interest. Commercial media today are not in the public interest. They&rsquo;re in the commercial interest.</p>

<p>With the exception of things like public radio, for as long as it&rsquo;s existed, have been funded through patrons.</p>

<p>Brain Pickings is similar to a library, it&rsquo;s funded by people who find value in it. And it&rsquo;s optionally so. So it&rsquo;s not every time the page loads they are forced to pay.</p>

<p>Because that is essentially what is happening with traditional ad-supported media. Every time you load a page, you pay. You pay with you being there.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being sold. No matter what is on that page - you&rsquo;re paying for it.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for making Brain Pickings different.</em></p>
