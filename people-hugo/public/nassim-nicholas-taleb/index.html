<p><em><a href="https://medium.com/@nntaleb">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> gives a short introduction to the idea of <a href="https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc">antifragility</a>. This concept is covered in length in Taleb&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680">Antifragile Thingss That Gain From Disorder</a>. It&rsquo;s part of a series of books from Taleb. The others are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493754906&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fooled+by+randomness">Fooled by Randomness</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493754924&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=black+swan">The Black Swan</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bed-Procrustes-Philosophical-Practical-Aphorisms/dp/0812982401/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493754940&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Bed+of+Procrustes">The Bed of Procrustes</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>This book and interview are difficult to understand. It&rsquo;s quite the idea and concept, but Taleb knows that too. I&rsquo;ve found a few great summaries here that can help: <a href="http://www.maxmednik.com/home/notes-on-antifragile-by-nassim-nicholas-taleb">Max Mednik&rsquo;s extensive notes</a>, <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/lessons/antifragile/">notes from Nat Alison</a> and <a href="http://fourminutebooks.com/antifragile-summary/">four minute book notes</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-is-fragility-1-43-https-youtu-be-4vbk-2xe9zc-t-1m43s">What is fragility? <a href="https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=1m43s">1:43</a></h2>

<p>One day looking at a coffee cup, I realized that I may have an interesting definition of fragility.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get to anti-fragility in a minute, but you need to understand the fragile.</p>

<p>So we have an interesting definition of fragility.</p>

<p>Fragility is what does not like randomness. What does not like variability. What does not like shocks. What does not like a cluster of things.</p>

<p>And when I look at this coffee cup, when I put it on the table, it&rsquo;s safe on the table. It wants peace and tranquility.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fragile.</p>

<p>I realized the fragile has some properties.</p>

<p>Now that we can define fragile that way, does not like some shocks and a few other things.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what is the opposite.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="opposite-of-fragile-2-44-https-youtu-be-4vbk-2xe9zc-t-2m44s">Opposite of Fragile <a href="https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=2m44s">2:44</a></h2>

<p>If I&rsquo;m sending a package to South Africa from New York, what do I write on it?</p>

<p>Fragile. Equals, in other words, handle with care.</p>

<p>The opposite of such a package would necessarily be something not neutral. Just like the opposite of concave is not linear. The opposite of positive concavity is not linear, it&rsquo;s negative concavity.</p>

<p>So the opposite of fragile would not be the equivalent of &ldquo;hey I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; It would be something written on it, please mishandle.</p>

<p>And that gives us a definition of the opposite of the fragile.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-examples-from-history-3-49-https-youtu-be-4vbk-2xe9zc-t-3m49s">3 Examples from History <a href="https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=3m49s">3:49</a></h2>

<p>The Ancients they had the concept that something like disorder. They used it extensively, they understood it.</p>

<p>But somehow with science we lose this ancient wisdom because they&rsquo;re not formatted in a crisp way with definitions.</p>

<p>They had the image of Damocles. I&rsquo;m sitting here and there is a sword on top of me, nothing good can happen just like the coffee cup. Nothing good can happen, except something bad can happen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m either going to be neutral, no better off, or worse off. Just like the coffee cup, it can break, but it&rsquo;s not going to improve from any random event.</p>

<p>The second one is Phoenix, the mythical bird. You shoot it, it comes back. You shoot it, it comes back. It&rsquo;s not going to improve. It&rsquo;s not going to worsen.</p>

<p>And the third category, of course, would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRNvoxxSNsY">Hydra</a>. One head, two grow back. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to attack it, attacking it will make it a lot stronger. You have to beware.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s up to a point. In the Mythology, Hydra was contained by tricks because you always have some vulnerability somewhere.</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re always fragile or anti-fragile with respect to something.</p>

<p>For example, this coffee cup may be more fragile with respect to shocks than it is with respect to heat. It could be the opposite for a plastic coffee cup.</p>

<p>It would be much more thermally fragile, but much more robust when it comes to shocks.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="volatility-5-42-https-youtu-be-4vbk-2xe9zc-t-5m42s">Volatility <a href="https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=5m42s">5:42</a></h2>

<p>I noticed one thing as an option trader, when you don&rsquo;t like volatile, when you have a portfolio that is fragile, a 20 percent drop in the market would harm you more than twice than a 10 percent drop.</p>

<p>So there is some linearity. There is some class of what we call acceleration. There is an acceleration of the harm.</p>

<p>This, effectively, can allow us to detect fragility. Because everything that is fragile has some non-linearity.</p>

<p>I can tap on this [coffee cup], it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I increase 10 percent, it breaks. I can tap a thousand times at a certain intensity, doesn&rsquo;t matter, 10 percent it would break.</p>

<p>There is effectively a non-linearity that needs to be present everywhere. And I&rsquo;ve based my research on that.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="upside-and-downside-6-33-https-youtu-be-4vbk-2xe9zc-t-6m33s">Upside and downside <a href="https://youtu.be/4vbk_2xE9zc?t=6m33s">6:33</a></h2>

<p>What is fragile has to have more downside than upside with respect to random thoughts.</p>

<p>And what is anti-fragile will benefit more from variability and necessarily, will have more upside than downside from random shocks.</p>

<p>For example, if I fall 10 meters, I&rsquo;m harmed more than 10 times than if I fell one meter.</p>

<p>If you have a portfolio that is anti-fragile, a 10 percent move in the market would benefit you a lot more than 10 times a one percent move in the market.</p>

<p>These concepts, of course, verbally don&rsquo;t appear clear. Like anything in science, it&rsquo;s not very intuitive. It takes some time to work through the points.</p>
