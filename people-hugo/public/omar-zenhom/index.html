<p><em>Omar Zenhom shares a quick review of Edward de Bono&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Thinking-Hats-Edward-Bono/dp/0316178314">Six Thinking Hats</a>, on the <a href="http://100mba.net/show/">$100 MBA podcast</a>. The framework presented by de Bono is practical and useful when making decisions.</em></p>

<p><em>Listen to Zenhom&rsquo;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/businessrepublic/mba408-must-read-the-six-thinking-hats-by-edward-de-bono">15 minute review here</a>, and check out a short transcription and graphic below.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-the-framework-2-40">Why the Framework? 2:40</h2>

<p>As Edward de Bono explains in his book, thinking is the ultimate human resource. Yet, we can never be satisfied with our most important skill.</p>

<p>No matter how good we become, we should always want to be better. Usually the only people who are satisfied with their thinking skills are those who are poor thinkers.</p>

<p>And Edward de Bono makes it very clear at the start of the book that the purpose of thinking is not to prove yourself right to your own satisfaction.</p>

<p>That encourages you to have a limited view. And shuts you off from options that may be better than the current one you&rsquo;re taking advantage of.</p>

<p>The main difficulty of thinking is confusion. People get overwhelmed. People get confused. They don&rsquo;t know how to organize their thinking.</p>

<p>When it comes to making a decision, there&rsquo;s many options. Many ways to go about these options. They are so many things that come into play like emotions, information, logic, hope, creativity.</p>

<p>All of this surrounds us when we&rsquo;re making a decision.</p>

<p>This book organizes the different ways you think. The different ways you make decisions. And allows you to see through each filter before you make a final decision.</p>

<p>In other words, it allows us to conduct our thinking as conductors. Somebody who is in control of the way we think.</p>

<p>When we take a moment to think about things in specific ways, in this book six defined ways, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to think clearly about a decision.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re less likely to get overwhelmed and more confident in the decision we make at the end.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-white-hat-4-16">The White Hat 4:16</h2>

<p>Each thinking hat has a color. And each color represents a different way of thinking.</p>

<p>The first hat is the white hat. The white hat is neutral. It&rsquo;s objective. The white hat is concerned with objective facts and figures.</p>

<p>The hat is you thinking in the way. So when you wear the white hat, you&rsquo;re very neutral and very objective.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re just looking at the facts in front of you. You&rsquo;re making decisions based on reality, on things you can actually prove are correct.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-red-hat-4-50">The Red Hat 4:50</h2>

<p>The red hat suggests anger or seeing red. Rage or extreme emotion or extreme passion.</p>

<p>The red hat gives the emotional point of view. Again this isn&rsquo;t bad, it just is.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-black-hat-5-04">The Black Hat 5:04</h2>

<p>The black hat is somber and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in ideas.</p>

<p>You might say the black hat is a bit cynical.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-yellow-hat-5-15">The Yellow Hat 5:15</h2>

<p>The yellow hat is sunny. It&rsquo;s positive. The yellow hat is optimistic. It&rsquo;s full of hope and positive thinking.</p>

<p>So in a lot of ways, the yellow hat and the black hat are sort of opposites.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-green-hat-5-29">The Green Hat 5:29</h2>

<p>Green as in grass, vegetation, abundance. Or fertile growth, let&rsquo;s say.</p>

<p>The green hat indicates creativity and new ideas. Children often wear the green hat.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re always growing, they&rsquo;re always thinking. They&rsquo;re saying why not. They&rsquo;re going for things.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-blue-hat-5-46">The Blue Hat 5:46</h2>

<p>The blue hat is cool. Not cool as in awesome. Cool as in chill.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also the color of the sky, which is above everything.</p>

<p>The blue hat is concerned with control. The organization of the thinking process and the use of the other hats.</p>

<p>How do I use these other hats?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="top-benefits-of-this-framework-7-46">Top Benefits of This Framework 7:46</h2>

<p>Number one it allows you to come to a decision and say things with minimal risk because you&rsquo;ve gone through all the different ways you can think about it.</p>

<p>Number two it creates an awareness that gives you multiple perspectives on an issue that you might have. Whether that&rsquo;s a challenge or disagreement in your business. It helps you understand the other people that disagree with you.</p>

<p>Number three it provides a convenient mechanize for switching gears, from going from one way of thinking to another in a deliberate way. You have these defined ways of going about thinking about this issue, challenge or decision using my red hat, using my black hat. How do I see things now?</p>

<p>Number four it organizes the way you think about something.</p>

<p>And number five, which is probably the biggest takeaway I got from the book, is it helps you as an individual to expand your thinking capacity.</p>

<p>By adopting other perspectives that aren&rsquo;t necessarily your own.</p>

<p>This is important for you to be a well-rounded leader. You&rsquo;re going to be leading different kinds of people, different kinds of opinions.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t just see things in your way. You have to see things in everybody&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ll be able to communicate with them in a better way if you can see things from their perspective.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="an-example-11-49">An Example 11:49</h2>

<p>A quick example is when hiring someone new. I take a look at their experience, their attitude, how the interview.</p>

<p>And I think about hiring or not hiring through these six thinking hats.</p>

<p>For example, I&rsquo;ll look at it through a white hat perspective. I&rsquo;ll look at the information on the resumes. The actual facts and figures. What have they done in the past that will prove they&rsquo;ll be good at this position?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll then take a look at it with my red hat on. How do I feel about this person? Were they friendly? Did I get a good vibe on the actual interview? Do I like them? Do I actually want to spend time with them as a colleague?</p>

<p>Then I&rsquo;ll look at the situation with my black hat on. I&rsquo;m looking for faults now. They&rsquo;re about a minute late, two minutes late on that Skype call. Does that matter? There was a typo in their email to me the second time around. So I&rsquo;m looking through that hat.</p>

<p>Then I&rsquo;ll put on my yellow hat. And be more optimistic. Take a look at who referred this person. This is a great person that referred them.</p>

<p>And given the circumstance they were nervous on this interview, they did an amazing job.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll put my green hat on. Does this person have potential to grow?
To expand? To become even better?</p>

<p>Lastly, I put my blue hat on and look at all the different hats at the same time. And I evaluate. How do I feel about it after I&rsquo;ve gone through that whole situation?</p>

<p>I spend about two to three solid minutes thinking about this decision with each hat. And now that I&rsquo;ve gone through that cycle, I can say, you know what, I should hire this person.</p>

<p>Because as I&rsquo;ve went through this exercise, I think they&rsquo;d be a good fit. That it will be a better decision to hire them than not to hire them.</p>
